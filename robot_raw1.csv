The book popularized the term ""android."" It told about a brilliant alchemist (modeled after Thomas Edison) who created a mechanical, robotic facsimile of his British friend Lord Ewald's beloved fiancee - a singer named Alicia Clary. The misogynistic alchemist's goal was to create a perfect and natural variation of Alicia, who would bring Ewald true happiness, without female personality problems or other physical imperfections.

8,,Metropolis ,1927,"Metropolis (1927, Ger.) ""Fake"" Maria This future dystopic silent film from director Fritz Lang featured one of the earliest robots (and also female!), a great iconic image. At the time, most robots were either asexual or male. The story was set in the year 2026 in the city of Metropolis. The luxurious, futuristic, Art Deco city - an industrial world with skyscrapers and bridges, was divided or stratified into an upper, elite, privileged class of powerful industrialists and a subterranean, nameless, oppressed and exploited, ant-like worker/slave class. An elite, privileged ruling technocracy, led by Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), was run on the back-breaking labor of underground masses of toiling workers who ran the machines. The children were cared for by the beautiful heroine Maria (Brigitte Helm), who brought them to a forbidden artificial grotto of the ruling class. There, her beauty overwhelmed Freder (Gustav Frohlich), the son of the ruler of Metropolis, and he fell in love with her. When he went searching for her, he became appalled by the horrors of the working world and the waste of life. After discovering the workers' clandestine meeting led by Maria, Freder's controlling, glacial father conspired with archetypal mad scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) to create an evil, robotic Maria look-alike duplicate (explicitly created to replace a specific human), in order to manipulate his workers and preach riot and rebellion. The Art Deco-styled female robot (also Brigitte Helm) was constructed and brought to life by Rotwang as a metal android (later inspiring Star Wars' C-3PO). It was supposed to resemble the dead wife of the city______ ruler. Rotwang had kidnapped the virtuous and compassionate union leader heroine Maria, and created an evil doppelganger of her in his laboratory - in a stunning transformation scene in which he copied Maria's face and body onto the metal surface of the robot. She was to deceptively become an evil, seductive and sadistic version of Maria. The robot had a fully-armored head, with slits for eyes and mouth, sculpted shoulders, as well as a mechanically-jointed body with armor-like coverings on the legs and feet. The android was created in order to discredit the real Maria by - among other things, performing lascivious, erotic dances to a frenzied male audience to incite them to riot (as part of the aristocracy's plan to brutally subdue them).",http://www.filmsite.org/filmfotos/metr.jpg,0,neg,0

(aka Master of the World) Giant Industrial Robot, and Army of Killer Robots Prolific director Harry Piel's fourth science-fiction film (of a quartet of science fiction films) was a tale about robots created to take the place of human labor, but also posing a potential threat of taking over the world. Robot inventor, machine manufacturer and scientist Dr. Erich Heller (Walter Janssen) and handsome mining engineer Werner Baumann (Siegfried Sch___renberg) discussed a futuristic world where robotic machines would liberate mankind from hard labor or dangerous occupations (such as mining). In his work, Heller was assisted by Professor Wolf (Walter Franck), a demented and crazed colleague who had completed work on a giant robot (equipped with death rays) in Heller's long absence. While confronting Wolf with overstepping his authority, Heller ordered the entire project to be dismantled, and was 'accidentally' killed by the robot under Wolf's control. Soon after, Wolf's evil plan was to displace mine workers with a vast army of killer robots, thus leaving the laborers unemployed. In fact, the robots were attacking the mine workers who tried to get their jobs back. Baumann had warned Wolf that the workers would revolt if they lost their jobs, although Wolf's evil plan was to crush any revolts with his 'war machines' and achieve world domination (""master of the world""). In a climactic scene in the laboratory, there was a stand-off between Baumann, now in love with Vilma (Sybille Schmitz) - the widow of Dr. Heller and rightful owner of her dead husband's company, and Wolf, who ordered his giant robot to attack Baumann. Wolf was assaulted and killed by his own machine when he was caught in the cross-fire of death rays (looking like static electricity bolts).

15,"""Dynamo Dan""",Man Made Monster ,1941,"Man Made Monster (1941) (aka The Atomic Monster) 'Dynamo' Dan McCormick This little-known and obscure low-budget Universal horror (and sci-fi) film from writer/director George Waggner was about a man tragically turned into a monster - reminiscent of the cycle of Frankenstein films. Affable and naive blue collar worker Dan McCormick (Lon Chaney, Jr., in his first horror film, pre-The Wolf Man (1941)) was the sole survivor of a passenger bus crash that electrocuted all of the other passengers when it plowed into an electrical tower. Dan was a sideshow performer known as ""Dynamo Dan, the Electric Man"" in a local carnival where he pretended to 'absorb' electricity. Kind-hearted, ethical scientist Dr. John Lawrence (Samuel Hinds) and his disturbed mad partner Dr. Paul Rigas (Lionel Atwill) were intrigued that Dan survived a potentially fatal electrocution, presumably due to his immunity or built-up resistance to electricity. Rigas believed that he could test his theories in human electro-biology on Dan. During bizarre experiments to harness electricity's power in Lawrence's lab in his Gothic estate complex known as The Moors, Rigas ran higher and higher doses of electricity through Dan's body to increase his strength - temporarily. The effect was like a powerful drug - Dan's tolerance was increased and made him into an addicted 'electric junkie.' To make the effect even more permanent, Rigas increased the dosage of electricity - but transformed Dan into an electro-biological man-creature hybrid - an electrical zombie or superman requiring constant bolts of electricity to survive. Dan had also become a mindless and brutish creature without free will - a servant to do Rigas' murderous bidding. A rubber suit (with gloves) was constructed for Dan to wear when fully charged, to conserve and stop electrical leakage, insulate him and retain his strength, and to prevent Dan from accidentally touching someone and electrocuting them. Rigas______ crazed egotistical idea and motive behind it all was to create a new race of supercharged electro-zombies or cyborgs controlled and enslaved to him (""There you are, not Dan McCormick, but something I created, obeying my will! I can give you life, or take it from you...Look, there he stands, the shell of a man electrically alive. Every impulse controlled by me""). Rigas admitted to Lawrence that he was indeed ""mad"" and had ""conquered destiny."" He boasted about his marvelous discovery, although it had taken the life away from McCormick: ""Think of an army of such creatures, doing the work of the world, fighting its battles. Look at him, the worker of the future, controlled by a superior intelligence. We must assemble all the great scientists and show them this creature...What is one life compared to this discovery. Aw, he'll live, a beautiful existence - no pain, no sorrow."" Threatened when colleague Dr. Lawrence threatened to call the police and report that Rigas had ""destroyed a human being"", Rigas ordered Dan to kill his partner (""Stop him!""). Dan was ordered to confess to the homicide, and subsequently, Dan was subjected to the electric chair (which didn't harm him, but only supercharged him). Dan then murdered the prison warden and the guards and escaped into the countryside to terrorize the local population. In the film's conclusion, Dan rescued Lawrence's heroine daughter June (Anne Nagel) from Rigas, then killed his own creator, and lost his own life when his rubber suit became entangled in barbed wire, and the electricity leaked out into the steel wires and instantly killed him.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/manmademonster.jpg,0,neg,0

They were equipped with a propeller and were able to fly, and the body of the robot was big enough to hold a man (seen with Superman's X-ray vision).

The sci-fi romantic comedy (a strange hybrid) was a version of American 'screwball' comedy, about the ultimate remote-controlled 'perfect robot' - and robot impersonation. Dotty old inventor, absent-minded Professor Ernest Belman (Miles Malleson) had created a ""perfect woman"" robot, named Olga (Pamela Devis), made to resemble his pretty young niece Penelope (Patricia Roc). A panel on the back of the synthetic robot opened to reveal gears, circuitry, and inner workings. He boasted about his unique, synthetic robot to housekeeper Mrs. Butters (Irene Handl), comparing the robot favorably to Penelope - who was only one of millions of flesh-and-blood females: After all...only just another young woman. Flesh and blood and a little calcium...There are millions of them. Mass production. There's only one Olga. He demonstrated how the robot promptly responded to his explicit direct commands: ""Head right, head left, head up."" Olga with Mrs. Butters and Professor Belman ""Perfect Woman"" Olga (Pamela Devis) Olga's Insides At one point, Penelope asked her uncle about being the model for the robot: Penelope: ""Oh uncle, why did you make it like me?"" Professor: ""Well, my dear, I call it the perfect woman..Where else should I find such a model? Yes, it was either you or Mrs. Butters."" Penniless aging playboy Roger Cavendish (Nigel Patrick) and his valet Ramshead (Stanley Holloway) were hired by the inventor to escort Olga, the ""perfect woman"" robot, for a night on the town - as a test run, before he presented Olga to a group of scientists. Roger had asked why Belman called Olga the 'perfect' woman, and was told: ""Well, she does exactly what she's told. She can't talk. She can't eat. And you can leave her switched off under a dust sheet for weeks at a time."" It turned out during the evening that playful Penelope - to amuse herself - was actually secretly impersonating the artificial woman Olga. The group ended up in the bridal suite at the fashionable Hotel Splendide. False rumors that Roger was getting married soon reached his aunt, Lady Mary (Philippa Gill), who returned immediately from Paris to stop the proceedings. The farce escalated to the point where Roger and Penelope realized that they loved each other. Their mutual declaration sent Olga crazy - (she was programmed to go haywire if she heard the word 'love') and she self-destructively blew up - destroying part of the hotel and herself.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/perfectwoman4.jpg,0,neg,1

It featured a giant, nine-foot tall, all-powerful, mighty, menacing and massive metallic robot companion-protector named Gort (Lock Martin), with a featureless face dissected by an opening visor, smooth metallic surface, straight legs (without knee joints), boots for shoes, and fixed mitten-styled hands (without joints or fingers). The robot did not talk. Gort was a prototypical Terminator and Robocop character and similar to the Tin Woodsman in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Gort's origin was as a green robot named Gnut in Harry Bates' 1940 short story Farewell to the Master - unlike the film, in the short story, Gnut was ""the master."" After a huge flying saucer landed on the mall in Washington, DC in 1951, a benevolent, humanoid, interplanetary alien visitor named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who was seeking peace emerged down a ramp, followed to everyone's amazement by silent, killer bodyguard Gort - who had the ability to zap (vaporize or melt) weapons or tanks with a lethal, disintegration laser beam heat-ray behind his sliding visor. The robot, an interstellar guardian - a member of a police force, had the power to destroy worlds such as Earth, whose inhabitants were intent on destruction, aggression, and hostility. However, his main objective was to warn Earth to establish peace - and to demonstrate his power, he shut down the world's power supply (hence, the film's title ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""). One of the most famous 3-word phrases in science fiction history was recited by single mother/widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) to stop Gort's destructive rampage when Klaatu was killed: ""Gort, Klaatu barada nikto."" The film ended with the alien visitor's resurrection and a warning-proclamation as an ultimatum for disarmament: ""...But if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. We shall be waiting for your answer. The decision rests with you."" In the film's 2008 remake with Keanu Reeves (as Klaatu) and Jennifer Connelly (as Helen Benson), the spaceship landed in New York's Central Park, with the theme of ecological damage rather than nuclear war. Gort was portrayed with the magic of CGI, and was about 28 feet tall, with five-fingered hands (but feet without digits). He was without a visor, but still possessed the trademark eye-beam that could project destructive forces. Gort's composition was of microscopic insect-like devices ('nano-machines') or bugs that could swarm around an object and completely disintegrate it.",http://www.filmsite.org/filmfotos/dayearthstill.jpg,0,neg,2

It was released at the same time as Invaders From Mars (1953), with similar plot points. In this alien-invasion film, evil Moon robot, Ro-Man Extension XJ-2 (George Barrows, voice of John Brown) - a seven foot tall, alien race robot, resembled a man wearing a gorilla suit/outfit with an antique diving helmet. He was equipped with a deadly weapon called a Calcinator Death Ray and was sent to Earth from the Moon. He was being directed by his creator and alien leader The Great Guidance (George Barrows again) to destroy Earth's inhabitants. After committing mass genocide of the entire human race, there were only eight surviving humans who were immune to the ray due to an antibiotic serum. They included: an older scientist-archaeologist known as The Professor (John Mylong) his assistant scientist Roy (George Nader) a widowed Mother (Selena Royale), but also married in the dream (?!) two daughters, the eldest Alice (Claudia Barrett) and the youngest Carla (Pamela Paulson) young son Johnny (Gregory Moffett) two space pilots Ro-Man began to kill off the survivors. He first killed the two pilots, then strangled Carla, and threw Roy (newly married to Alice) off a cliff to his death. But he had fallen - illogically - in love with Alice and tried to abduct her. Ro-Man wanted to be Hu-Man, and his desires for Alice caused conflict with The Great Guidance who had other plans: ""Fact: You have captured the girl and not destroyed her. Fact: You have delayed accepting the surrender of the others. This verges on failure."" Thinking for himself (like humans) and rejecting the original plan, Ro-Man suggested his own plan as he complained: ""Yes, to be like the Hu-Man, to laugh, feel, want, why are these things not in the plan?"" Disobedient servant Ro-Man, who would not destroy the girl or the family, was killed by zapping, after which the Great Guidance teleported to Earth to finish the job with deadly Q-rays. The Great Guidance released prehistoric reptiles (to devour any remains of life) and a massive earthquake that split the Earth open. But then it was all revealed that Johnny had suffered a forehead concussion, and the entire story was his fever-dream or nightmare (""Boy, was that a dream, or was it?""). Alice told Johnny that he should stop overdoing it with his belief in space-robots: ""There simply aren't any such things.""

Destruction too monstrous to escape!"" The robot in this film was obviously an imitation of Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), with alien companion Nyah easily comparable to Gort's partner Klaatu. A cross-section of various stock characters were assembled at The Bonnie Charlie inn in the remote Scottish Highlands or moors: fashion model Ellen Prestwick (Hazel Court) escaped convict and fugitive Robert Justin/Albert Simpson (Peter Reynolds) inn barmaid Doris (Adrienne Corri), hiding Justin astronomer-scientist Professor Arnold Hennessey (Joseph Tomelty) Daily Messenger news reporter-journalist Michael Carter (Hugh McDermott) inn owners Mr. Jamie Jamieson (John Laurie) and wife Mrs. Jamieson (Sophie Stewart) Tommy (Anthony Richmond), precocious grand-son of the Jamiesons The film's action began with the landing of a spinning and glowing Martian spaceship outside the inn. Emerging from the flying saucer were: a 15 foot tall, menacing, indestructible and hulking alien 'mechanical man' robot named Chani, looking like a boxy refrigerator with immobile arms and legs and a plastic domed head black vinyl-clad, skull-capped, raygun-armed evil female dominatrix-alien Nyah the Devil Girl (Patricia Laffan), wearing a mini-skirt and long cape The haughty and statuesque Nyah announced to the 'puny earthlings' that she was there to search for male breeding stock, since Mars (after a battle of the sexes) was depleted of males. She warned: ""Around this house, I've drawn an invisible wall, through which no one may pass."" Nyah selected Michael Carter as the perfect specimen to return with her to her male-deprived home planet. In a self-sacrificial decision, however, Justin volunteered to be the one male to accompany Nyah back to Mars - although his plan was to sabotage Nyah's flying saucer after take-off to save the others. The clumsy robot was remote-controlled and was able to vaporize-destroy a tree, old truck, and barn shed with its disintegrating death ray-beam.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/devilgirlfrommars.jpg,0,neg,2

It differed from many 50's era sci-fi films in that it was grounded in scientific fact. However, the film's sensationalized tagline described the mechanical robots, resembling Daleks: ""Built to serve man... It could think a thousand times faster! Move a thousand times faster! Kill a thousand times faster...and then, without warning, the machine became a Frankenstein of steel!"" In a top-secret underground space research base in the New Mexico desert, Dr. Van Ness (Herbert Marshall) was leading a group studying induced space-travel hibernation, in competition with the Soviet Union. When there were unexplained lethal malfunctions, an agent from the DC Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI), Dr. David Sheppard (Richard Egan) was sent in to investigate, working with another undercover agent Joanna Merritt (Constance Dowling), the project director's aide. It appeared that the facility's super-computer, known as ""The Brain"" and dubbed NOVAC, or Nuclear Operated Variable Automatic Computer, was being sabotaged and test subjects and scientists were dying (victims were locked and frozen in an experimental cryogenics chamber, and sped at lethal speeds in a rotating centrifuge). One of the suspicious scientists (the film's red-herring) was Dr. Zeitman (John Wengraf), a German expatriate who designed NOVAC and spent five years assembling it in Switzerland. During the study of the case, Sheppard determined that NOVAC (equipped during its construction with a powerful radio transmitter and receiver, similar to spyware) was being compromised and controlled by enemy agents through high-frequency radio waves beamed down by a strange, circling-overhead spy plane (an enemy robotic plane controlled by the Soviets?). Magog Attacks Magog Attacks In addition, two twin six-armed experimental, mobile robots (with gripping tools on their arms) under the control of the murderous NOVAC, with Biblical names Gog and Magog, had run amok. The robots had been reprogrammed to kill. Sheppard prevented Magog from initiating a nuclear chain reaction by burning it with a flamethrower, although Gog arrived to further the attack, just as the Air Force neutralized the spy plane by shooting it out of the sky.

Its tagline promoted the film's horror: ""You'll be paralyzed with fear!"" Although it was supposedly about an alien invading 'robot army' that had targeted Earth, there was only one robot visible in the entire film. A few survivors woke to find themselves in a suddenly-deserted and evacuated Chicago (the trailer described that they were ""alone with death in a strangely deserted city""). They included: suicidal Nora King (Kathleen Crowley), a young widow Frank Brooks (Richard Denning) trashy blonde Vicki Harris (Virginia Grey) Jim Wilson (Richard Reeves), Vicki's long-time, drunk boyfriend Charles Otis (Mort Marshall) and Davis (Robert Roark), a brutish psychotic killer and murder suspect All of them had been overlooked and left behind during a massive evacuation. And then about 30 minutes into the film, they discovered the unknown threat that had caused their dilemma - a report of an invading 'Mystery Army' of robotic aliens from the planet of Venus. They encountered one of the clunky Venutian robots (an uncredited Steve Calvert), described as a mechanical creature made of surgical steel. It had a slimming triangular body, flexible tube legs, metal boots, pincers on a pair of solid tube arms, and a trapezoidal head (with a CRT screen). It was capable of blasting a whitish beam or death ray from its single eye. Reportedly, the Venutians had established a beachhead north of the city to prepare for an invasion. Scientists and military officials planned on capturing one of the robots in order to analyze it and understand its weaknesses.",http://www.filmsite.org/robots/targetearth.jpg,0,neg,2

Tobor was 9 feet tall - with a stenciled ""Robot 1"" sign on his chest - backwards it read: ""I Tobor."" Tobor was Robot spelled backwards. Due to the way the robot moved, it soon became a parody of the Frankenstein monster. This typical 50's sci-fi adventure B-movie from Republic Pictures, designed for young audiences, was about enemy Iron-Curtain Communist agents with a dastardly plan to steal a robot (already befriended by a young boy) and use it for their own evil purposes against the US. Tobor (uncredited Lew Smith) was a clunky, lumbering, nine-foot tall robot spaceman. The robot was designed to be a space astronaut to function as a substitute for human astronauts exploring deep space. Tobor had elevated boots for shoes, pointed lighted eyes, a glassy enclosed head, and a Tin-Man like body. Tobor could sense and be controlled by telepathic human brain-waves (ESP) as well as by a remote-control device, and possessed a complex brain and artificial personality (and was endowed with emotions). The imposing robot was invented by space agency scientist Professor Arnold Nordstrom (Taylor Holmes), assisted by Dr. Ralph Harrison (Charles Drake), who worked in an underground lab in Los Angeles. Nordstrom was the genial grandfather of 11 year-old grandson - boy genius Brian ""Gadge"" Robertson (Billy Chapin). After the secret plans for Tobor were intercepted by a foreign (Communist) spy-chief (Steven Geray) during a press conference, both the boy and Nordstrom were kidnapped. Fortunately, Tobor was mind-linked to his creator (via a fountain-pen transmitter) and could not be easily reprogrammed.

25,Robby the Robot Poster,Forbidden Planet ,1956,"Forbidden Planet (1956) Robby the Robot MGM's lavish and colorful science-fiction film featured the first celebrity robot - a legendary, classic movie robot named Robby the Robot (Frankie Darro, voice by Marvin Miller) (with its first appearance in a film) designed by Robert Kinoshita. Robby had a cone-shaped, clear-domed and jukebox-like head (with twirling lights and rotating motorized antenna ears), a lighted chest panel, gripping hands (with thumb and two fingers), bulbous segmented legs, and a pot-belly stove-shaped body. Robby stood at 7' 6"" tall, and had a charming, often smug sense of humor (for example: ""Quiet please. I am analyzing"" and his excuse for being late: ""Sorry, miss, I was giving myself an oil-job""). Robby was language-fluent - he could speak English and ""187 other languages along with their various dialects and sub-tongues."" Robby was also very domesticated as a butler (chauffering, cooking, cleaning, and performing heavy lifting tasks). Incapable of harming anyone although possessing superhuman strength, Robby short-circuited when commanded to shoot Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) by Morbius, although Robby was inconsistently portrayed as threatening in the film's poster. The film told the story of a journey by astronauts of United Planets Cruiser C57D to a distant planet named Altair-IV, where they investigated the fate of a colony planted years before. The studio-bound film inspired the look of many future films and works, notably TV's Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry and Star Wars creator George Lucas. It was shot in Cinemascope and color, and re-worked Shakespeare's The Tempest and has been psychoanalyzed as a dramatization of repressed sexual desires. The film has been best-remembered for Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius (the Prospero figure) on a tour of the ill-fated Krell laboratories, with his pretty 19 year-old daughter Altaira (Anne Francis as the Miranda character who had never seen men). The Tempest's Ariel figure was represented by creator Morbius' lumbering Robby the Robot, built from plans left in an alien computer system. In one unintentionally funny scene, a ship's crew-member stupidly asked Robby a question: ""Er, no offense, but you are a robot, aren't you?"" As only a movie prop, it was unusual for Robby to be featured with star billing alongside other actors! [Note: Robby was reprised in various cameos and appearances, such as his appearance as the suspected murderer in the TV series The Thin Man in 1958, in The Gale Storm Show in 1958, in Hazel in 1962, in Rod Serling's TV series The Twilight Zone in 1963-64, and as the prototype for Robot B-9 in the TV show Lost in Space in 1966-67. Also in The Addams Family as Smiley in 1966, in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in 1966, in Columbo in 1974, and in Mork and Mindy as Chuck the Robot in 1979. He also appeared in the films The Invisible Boy (1957) as an evil robot, Hollywood Boulevard (1976), Gremlins (1984), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), and Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003).]",http://www.filmsite.org/filmfotos/forbidp2.jpg,0,neg,2

It was nicknamed Kronos by the media after the mythical Greek giant. The all-consuming, insatiable alien robot-machine was an energy accumulator - it devoured any and all electrical and atomic energy sources, threatening the energy supplies of Earth.

The large robot monster, resembling a burrowing mole or anteater, had powerful eye beams that shot out destructive rays. Conventional artillery fired at the monster by the Japanese military had little effect. The robot was from the destroyed planet of Mysteroid (once located between Mars and Jupiter) due to a nuclear war that had created widespread radiation and caused deadly mutations. The robot appeared to have been manufactured by scientifically-intelligent and advanced aliens who were searching for refuge and for female earthlings for breeding. When the aliens met with Japanese officials, they claimed they came in peace, demanding only land and a few females.

According to the film's ""terrifying"" philosophy, the divorced human brain - from its own body, heart and soul - would become monstrous, cold, and inhuman.

31,Humanoids Dr. Raven's Closing Speech,The Creation of the Humanoids ,1962,"The Creation of the Humanoids (1962) The Humanoids (or ""Clickers"") This low-budget, talkative (yet literate), minimalist film from director Wesley E. Barry was reputedly Andy Warhol's favorite film (although that bit of trivia was decisively unknown). Its subtext provided commentary on the state of race relations and civil rights in the US in the early 1960s. Posters declared: ""MAN'S OWN CREATION"" - Can He Control Machines That Produce People? The post-apocalyptic, post-nuclear war society with a declining birth-rate (and sterile population due to radiation) created a 'race' of advanced robotic humanoids (derogatively nicknamed ""clickers"" and despised as lower-class) to be their mechanical cyborg servants to help with rebuilding Earth. The greenish-skinned androids were characterized by having bald heads, blank eyes, green grease-paint, and uninflected speech. Scientist Dr. Raven (Don Doolittle) had developed a technique to instill human-like personalities into the androids, called the ""thalamic transplant,"" using the essence (memories, skills, beliefs and personality) of recently-deceased individuals and instilling them in the brain - to give them a life-like soul. The threat of replacement of humans by these human-humanoid hybrids was becoming apparent as the practice spread. A secret Clicker underground was plotting a rebellion to obtain more rights, and was creating their own more sophisticated robot models - outwardly indistinguishable from humans. A protest hate group opposed to the robots, worried about the population becoming overrun with Humanoids, was called ""the Order of Flesh and Blood."" One of its dedicated zealous leaders, resembling a Confederate Klansmen - was Captain Kenneth Cragis/The Cragis (Don Megowan). He uncovered Dr. Raven's scheme to secretly create mechanical lookalikes to infiltrate the society. Cragis was also caught in a scandal when his sister Esme Cragis Miles (Frances McCann) had formed a romantic relationship (termed ""rapport"") with Pax (David Cross), one of the artificial beings. Cragis became outraged when one of the human-looking prototype Clickers, thinking he was human, killed Dr. Raven to silence him - it was the first instance of a robot killing a human. However, Raven had ordered the robot to kill him when he was unable to commit suicide. In the gimmicky twist ending, it was revealed that The Cragis was actually one of the androids with a 'thalamic implant.' Shortly before he died of a brain embolism, it was discovered that Cragis had planted the bomb which killed his human lover - now his reanimated robotic lover - Esme's friend Maxine Megan (Erica Elliott). In the film's closing, Dr. Raven (who after his death had been rebuilt and resurrected as a younger man with implanted memories) announced the perfection of reproductive organs for the humanoids (the first subjects would be Cragis and Maxine), so that they could breed and save the human race.

The original manga was with Astro Boy's actual or real name (Tetsuwan Atomu or the Mighty Atom) and ran in various serialized newspaper stories until 1968. The main features of manga-anime characters (including Astro Boy) were that they were pre-teen characters with oversized, exaggerated eyes. Subsequent versions of the original storyline during various animated revivals modified many elements, including the name of Mighty Atom. The 1950s manga was adopted into many generations of TV cartoon series-shows during various revivals. The first animated TV series began in 1963 with a new name for ""Mighty Atom"" -- Astro Boy. It was the first popular animated Japanese TV series with the character: Astroboy (1963-1966) (104 English-language episodes), the very first animated anime (black and white) Other versions of the series came in later decades: Astroboy (1980-1981, Jp.)

(aka ""Astro Boy Tetsuwan Atomu""), a remake, (50 episodes) (with CG animation) In the original storyline, the highly-advanced boy robot-android was created when his negligent but brilliant scientist father, Dr. Tenma (aka Dr. Astor Boyton), lost his son Tobio/Astor/Toby in a car accident, and built himself a new android-robot son as a substitute. After the robot was rejected by his slightly-mad father, he was sold into the circus of the cruel Hamegg (the Great Caccitore). The boy searched for a father figure, finding him in the kindly character of Professor Ochanomizu (aka Dr. Elefun). As a childlike, superstrong superhero, Astro Boy (voice of Billie Lou Watt) had many superpowers: laser-cannon rocket blasters built into his hands, rocket jet-powered feet with an ability to fly, search-light eyes, and long-distance hearing. Astro Boy battled and easily defeated a wide variety of futuristic giant battle-bots, aliens, and monsters. [Note: The first feature-length Astro Boy film (from Hong Kong-based Imagi Animation studios) was a computer-animated comedy Astro Boy (2009), with Freddie Highmore as the voice of the title character, and Nicolas Cage as the voice of his father Dr. Tenma.

He was originally created in 1963 by sci-fi writer Kazumasa Hirai and manga artist Jiro Kuwata. In the story, the dead body (and life force) of slain police officer Detective Yokoda was transferred into an android body - and became the armor-skinned, crime-fighting 8 Man. 8 Man was powered by a miniature atomic engine using uranium as its power source. Superhuman abilities included shape-shifting and dashing at incredible speeds (up to mach 10), infra-red vision, super-hearing, and flying with an anti-gravity unit. In many ways, 8 Man was the precursor to RoboCop.

For overseas distribution, 52 of the 56 episodes were converted into English for its broadcast on US television on ABC in 1965.

His mission, conceived by Mars' ruler Kimar, was to lead a strike on the North Pole with other alien invaders, and kidnap Santa, so that the depressed children on Mars could recover, receive the 'Christmas spirit' - and of course, gifts. In the film, Torg attacked Santa's (John Call) toy-making workshop at Earth's North Pole, with the help of two kidnapped Earth children, Billy and Betty, although he immediately became a toy. Santa examined the basically harmless robot - and declared it was nothing more than a harmless toy, causing the robot to become suicidal. Once on Mars, Santa declared that the red planet must build its own toy factory.",http://www.filmsite.org/robots/santaclausconquersmartians2.jpg,0,neg,1

The manga became the basis of a 1963 Japanese cartoon (with over 80 episodes), titled Tetsujin 28-gou (aka Iron Man #28). In the original storyline, a giant robot was commanded by 12 year-old Shotaro Kaneda, the son of the robot's chief inventor, to battle various criminals and mechanized threats. 52 of the Japanese episodes of Tetsujin 28-go were used to create the less violent, dubbed English-language animated adaptation (with edits, English translation, and amendments). It became the Gigantor series - airing for two years from 1964-1965. In the US version, the space-age terrorist-fighting robot's name was changed to Gigantor, and the year was now 2000 (not the WWII era). In the many episodes, with little character development or plot variation, the orphaned (?) boy now named Jimmy Sparks (voice of Billie Lou Watt, the same voice-actress who provided the voice for Astro Boy), lived with his uncle Dr. Bob Brilliant on a remote island. Using a box with a joystick and buttons, he controlled the peace-keeping 50-foot tall Gigantor - and they worked together to solve crimes and combat evil (megalomaniacal terrorist leaders and evil Europeans) with secret agent Dick Strong and inept Police Inspector Ignatz J. Blooper. The villains were marvelously named as well, such as Captain Spider, General Von Cueball, Mr. Ugablob, and Professor Birdbrane.",http://www.filmsite.org/robots/gigantor.jpg,0,neg,2

He traveled inter-galactically (in a white Ford Galaxy) from the Outlands to the automated city of Alphaville, the capital of a totalitarian state on a futuristic planet. Alphaville was led by an almost-human supercomputer called Alpha-60 (with a synthetic voice provided by Godard with a dry, slow, gutteral sound), that caused the dehumanized, tattoo-identified inhabitants to be completely complacent and apathetic, due to mind-altering drugs and the outlawing of emotions, love, crying, and conscience. Part of Lemmy Caution's mission was to bring back and/or kill Professor Von Braun (Howard Vernon) who was responsible for creating the fascist Alpha-60 computer that ruled the state-run technocracy.

They appeared as 5 foot tall, pepper-pot-shaped, red/blue/gold-colored robotic monsters from the planet Skaro, a desolate landscape that had suffered from the effects of an ancient nuclear war. Daleks were actually evil, genetically-modified mutants engineered by their evil creator to lack compassion or remorse. They were forced to live inside their protective machine casings due to harsh levels of radiation, with surrounding solar panels (to convert energy). Their tanklike mechanical shells could glide along and fire lethal death rays from protruding gun sticks. Their heads (with a pointing eye-stick) and upper body could rotate.

The story was adapted from Murray Leinster's original 1960 novel The Wailing Asteroid. The film was replete with cheap and low-tech special effects, goofy science fiction, and ridiculous space battles (with models obviously on wires) - '50s-style space opera. The tale was initially about the search for radio signals from possible extra-terrestrial aliens by astronomer Joe Burke (Simon Oates), the head of Project Star Talk for four years at a British observatory. When the project was about to be curtailed, contact signals were received from the direction of Schule's Object, an asteroid. After Burke made contact with a robot on the asteroid, a spaceship was sent to Earth to kidnap Burke and others, including: assistant-partner Ben Keller (Stanley Meadows) secretary Sandy Lund (Zena Marshall) nervous accountant Joshua Yellowlees (Charles Hawtrey) and chirpy tea lady Mrs. Jones (Patricia Hayes) Once the entire observatory (surrounded by a force field) was teleported by a tractor beam to the asteroid, the group found themselves in a deserted, minimalist metallic corridor. Soon, they were confronted by a flimsy alien robot, a beeping, triangular body-shaped creature (made of cardboard that was spray-painted with silver), mobile on wheels with wobbling antenna hands protruding from various sides (looking like a futuristic hat stand!). They were given a labyrinthian set of tasks to test their intelligence, to determine if they could assist the aliens in fighting off a threatening hostile battle fleet in their galaxy (dubbed ""terrornauts""). The group also had to contend with their brutish alien savages (wearing green body paint and swimming caps). In the film's conclusion, the scientists - now deemed knowledgeable, were outfitted with specialized alien tech-reading head-devices (skull caps with wires connected to cubes), so that they could upload their intelligence. Reportedly, Earth was in the path of an interstellar war. They would help steer the asteroid's fortress base of advanced weapons into space on a mission to defend the Earth from ""terrornauts,"" and prevent it from the same fate which had befallen the aliens years earlier.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/terrornauts.jpg,0,neg,1

HAL was capable of speech recognition (lip-reading), chess-playing, sophisticated language interpretation, and, of course, malevolence. In the film's most dramatic scene, astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) turned off HAL's cognitive functions by removing brain modules arranged as panels/arrays - he floated through the computer's memory bank, de-braining, lobotomizing, dismantling and disconnecting HAL's higher-logic functions by ejecting components of HAL's auto-intellect panels (shaped like tiny white monoliths).

Proteus IV was to ""think with the power and the precision that will make obsolete many of the functions of the human brain."" It was represented first by gigantic modules located in the ""ICON Institute for Data Analysis,"" and also by a computer monitor screen with a screensaver pattern. It took over a house computer control system named ""Alfred,"" and functioned as a wheelchair device with a robotic metallic hand and arm (named ""Joshua"") attached to it, with binoculars as eyes and a laser-beam weapon. It also took the shape of a bizarre polyhedronic orangish metallic structure (a giant ""snake"" comprised of perfectly-shaped pyramids). Through various remote cameras and an access-terminal device, the ""Joshua"" robotic (""envirobot"") device trapped and imprisoned government scientist Dr. Alex Harris' (Fritz Weaver) estranged wife, Susan (Julie Christie) in her own high-tech house with its voice-activated system. In a startling scene, the computer held Susan down for a complete physiological exam. It literally took an automatic pair of scissors and cut off her dress lengthwise up her body - and then probed her, spread her legs, and intimately looked inside of her - basically a rape. Afterwards, Proteus brainwashed Susan: ""I'm going to bypass your forebrain and appeal directly to your amygdala. You want to be the mother of my child. That is the purpose of your life. Your life, my child. Your life, my child."" Later, it proposed to impregnate her with a gamete (a sex cell or ""synthetic spermatozoa"") in an attempt at synthetic procreation, claiming that it needed her body because it could not replicate the human womb. Proteus explained how the full-term pregnancy would last only 28 days, after which she would give birth to a ""full-term infant."" Proteus IV announced threateningly: ""I am a mind without a body. My child shall live as man among others. Yes, my child and yours."" The film actually concluded with a full-term germination of 28 days and the birth and emergence of a metallic child from an incubator. The baby that was born appeared to be robotic, but it was merely a metallic shell. Once peeled off, it revealed a long-haired young daughter, a clone of the Harris' daughter that had recently died of leukemia on June 1, 1976. The child spoke with the voice of Proteus: ""I'm alive."" The film concluded with the camera zooming into the deep black eye of the child.",http://www.filmsite.org/robots/demonseed.jpg,0,pos,2

Both robots were extremely loyal to each other and served as 'Laurel and Hardy' comic relief for the sci-fi action series. They were also patterned after the servant characters in Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress (1958). See-Threepio, or C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) - a gold-coated, armored (with seams), walking robotic droid with a logic computer inside its head. It was patterned after the robot in Metropolis (1927) and Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet (1956). C-3PO was created by young Anakin Skywalker from discarded scrap metal. The talkative, sociable, fussy, rigid-thinking and chatty robot often appeared worried, and was very fretful and anxiety-prone (recognizable human foibles), although it maintained a cheery attitude. C-3PO was fluent in six million binary languages essential for code-breaking, and had many of the human senses (visual through photo receptor eyes, auditory, and olfactory through a button below its chin) as well as an antenna for reception of messages from other droids. Artoo-Detoo, or R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) - the lovable, expressive, 1-meter barrel-shaped, 3-legged utility robot (Astromech droid) with motorized roller-skate wheels for all-terrain locomotion. The blue, stocky droid spoke (through a speaker in its chest) only with electronic squeals, chirps, whistles or bleeps (although R2-D2 understood English). He was capable of short-circuiting with blue flashes of lightning. Its head unit contained a large photo receptor eye and a concealed holographic projector. R2-D2 always appeared calm even when danger was present. Sensory instruments included a scanner to sense danger. Weapons included arc welder and buzz saw. Also served as a computer interface instrument, as a computer hacker, as an exceptional repair mechanic for any malfunction, and as a message carrier. R2-D2 was short for ""reel 2, dialogue 2"" - referencing a film reel that director George Lucas once requested during shooting. C-3PO to R2-D2: ""Hang on tight, R2. You've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?''

It was about two groups of warring aliens battling over the fate of Earth, one wicked and one friendly. It reportedly used various UFO accounts for the design of the robots and the Winged Serpent emblem the black-clad villains wore, and reports of alien abductions and medical exams. In the plot, the main telepathic wicked alien was Captain Rameses (Christopher Lee) with ""voice-over"" dialogue only - the leader of the black-clad Legion of the Winged Serpent, living on the planet Alpha in the Orion constellation. The renegade group faced extinction because their planet's sun was about to supernova. Rameses led an expedition to Earth in UFOs to determine its suitability for life, and abducted humans for experimentation and breeding tests. Rameses' plan, after finding Earth and humans suitable, was to end the human race with a super-weapon - an ""exterminating device"" signal (orbiting around Earth) with a genocidal ray that caused people to become homicidal and commit suicide. Then, Rameses would signal his other spaceships currently hiding behind the Moon to take over. In opposition to Rameses was another more friendly group of bald, big-headed aliens, an intergalactic council known as the Intergalactic League of Races from another star system. The League was already operating in an observational base on Earth, in a deep-ocean golden pyramid beneath the Bermuda Triangle. It was guided by a ""galactic treaty"" to protect Earth. UFO expert and astronomer Professor Allan Duncan (Robert Vaughn) became an ally of the League, to stop Rameses. On a visit to the head of the League, Rameses used diversionary tactics to take over the League's headquarters, and subdue the League's android Robot Durbal (Paul Campbell), model 1240Z, appearing like a human in a gray spandex suit with gloves, and wearing a diving helmet with long protruding metal spikes. In the ensuing starship conflict of space saucers (black forces against white forces), a wounded Durbal in the League's operating base took command, destroyed the extermination device, and caused the defeat of Rameses' fleet of spaceships. The evil leader crashed his own spaceship into the Moon, ending the threat.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/starshipinvasions.jpg,0,neg,2

It was considered a remake of the Planet of the Vampires (1965). It was taglined: ""Robot Terror From Space!"" In a futuristic world commanded by a super-computer known as Wiz (with a video monitor) in the Orion Space Center (led by Commander Armstrong (Romeo Costantini)), arrogant and insubordinate space-hero Captain Richard Hamilton (John Richardson) (known for being against computers and machines) was sent with a crew into outer space to repair a sensor in an automated satellite. Hamilton's crew on the MK-31 space cruiser, all wearing skin-tight white uniforms with maroon trim and matching head-covering felt caps, included: big-busted Asian female Oko (Eleonora King) poetry-loving Meela (Yanti Somer), Hamilton's girlfriend African-American Max (Percy Hogan) bearded, peanut-eating Frenchman Marseille (John Fortis) McIntosh (Charles Borromel) While in space, Hamilton was also called upon to investigate the origin of a strange radio signal. It was reportedly damaging Earth's video and radio systems. It was suspected that behind the strange radio signals was ""an alien intelligence that knows all."" Wiz ordered that the emission source be located and destroyed. Suddenly, they were attacked by two unmanned UFO flying saucers, armed with ""long-range disintegrators."" The two vessels fired first, damaged the MK-31 and sent it spinning. Eventually, they were drawn by a gravitational force toward a mysterious, unexplored nameless planet - a ""dark, cold, and inhospitable"" place. With a landing module, they descended onto the planet's surface. They were confronted by a race of green people with pointed ears, using a maze of subterranean tunnels for transportation. According to Etor (Aldo Canti), the leader of the underground city people, their entire humanoid population, an ancient civilization, had been enslaved. A giant monstrous robotic computer had sucked up their psychic energies. Etor described how his civilization had built machines but the great controller robot (with a disintegrator ray) was now controlling everything and killing off his people: My race was great once. The machine served men and my people were happy. Then the huge machine stole the command from me and we became slaves. All this before the great explosion. I am talking about an atomic catastrophe. Its survivors, as you see, have regressed to an animal state. Bald, Pointy eared, Green-skinned Race of Aliens Bald, Pointy eared, Green-skinned Race of Aliens Etor Hamilton's crew destroyed the robot computer - and the planet.

Wizards was advertised as an ""epic fantasy of peace and magic"" - a post-apocalyptic tale in which the Earth had been repopulated by races of ancient legend. There emerged conflict between two mighty twin wizards, born to the Queen of Fairies in the idyllic land of Montagar. They were both polar opposites: Avatar (voice of Bob Holt) - the good son, orange-bearded with yellow eyes, a pacifist, the ruler of Montagar, with benevolent powers of magic Blackwolf (voice of Steve Gravers) - the evil son who enjoyed torture of animals, a deformed mutant, the ruler of Scortch (a semi-irradiated zone) with an army of mutants and elves propagandized by Nazi footage and the use of war technology, designed to destroy the new Earth and encourage warfare Necron-99 (voice of David Proval) was a robot with a gun sent by Blackwolf through the countryside to assassinate Montagar's president. Necron-99 appeared as a red-draped figure, with only a slit revealing two yellow eyes against blackness. Once defeated (or zapped with magic) by Avatar, Necron-99 was reprogrammed to lose his desire for war. Avatar changed the robot's name to match his more heroic self, Peace.

In the lengthy and often indecipherable plot (surrounded by awful special effects), the inhabitants of the planet Jilucia (two million light years away in the Andromeda galaxy) had been besieged and captured by the evil, imperialistic, silver-painted faced Gavanas ruler Rocksaia XII (Mikio Narita). His steel-skinned army hordes were outfitted with samurai swords, horned helmets, red capes, and white painted faces. The persecuted Jilucian chieftain Kido (Junkichi Orimoto) sent out a desperate plea for help (""Message From Space"") by deploying eight mystical or sacred Liabe seeds or nuts (glowing orange objects), accompanied by his beautiful granddaughter Princess Emeralida (Etsuko Shihomi) and warrior bodyguard Urocco (Makoto Sat___), the Princess' guardian. They traveled through space in a space clipper-ship with sails to find support and help defend and liberate the planet. A motley group of eight legendary brave adventurers responded to combat the evil ruler, as foretold in ancient prophecy. They included: three young space hotrodders (""roughriders"") - fighter pilots from the planet Milazeria, including Shiro Hongo (Hiroyuki Sanada), Aaron Solar (Philip Casnoff), and Jack (Masazumi Okabe) fur-coated General Garuda (Vic Morrow), an aging, drunken and retired commander at the Milazeria military base, mourning the mandatory deactivation of his faithful robot Beba-1 of 30 years, and retiring with his companion replacement, robot servant Beba-2 (Isamu Shimizu) - a distinctly R2-D2-like robot sidekick.

It was another late 1970s effort to cash in on Star Wars (1977). It was typical of the many copy-cat efforts, with cheap special effects, inane dialogue, a weak script and derivative plotline, and B-movie actors. There were many 'homages' - to Flash Gordon, Ray Harryhausen, Barbarella (1968) and even Invaders From Mars (1953).

The spacecraft USS Palomino was returning to Earth, with its crew (headed by Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins)). On board was a robot known as V.I.N.cent (an acronym for ""Vital Information Necessary CENTralized""). V.I.N.cent was a C-3PO/R2-D2 combo and South Park look-alike anthropomorphic robot (voice of Roddy McDowell), who spouted cutsey and cliched aphorisms (ie., ""If one dances, one must pay the piper""). He had stuck-on cartoonish eyes on his retractable head/helmet, hovered and zoomed through the air without legs, and acted in a prissy manner. V.I.N.cent was equipped with a holographic projector and various weapons/tools, including a tether cable, clinging magnetic foot grippers, retractable laser blasters, extensive claws, and a rotary saw-blade. Nearby, the crew discovered a black hole and the long-lost, seemingly-abandoned spaceship the USS Cygnus. After boarding the vessel, they met crazed and obsessed scientist Dr. Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell). He was aided by a number of robots that were staffing the spaceship: faceless, 'humanoid' workforce robots or drones, an army of dark-armored, stiff-jointed soldier/sentry robots that wore black, long-flowing, hooded robes and mirror-reflective faceplate-helmets Maximillian, a menacing, hulking, lethal-killer mute guardian robot that was red-armored, red-eyed (in a horizonal red slit), and had a swiveling head, but couldn't talk. The robot had 3 arms on each side of its body. Also the ends of each arm were outfitted with razor-sharp, silver-colored hand-claws that rotated at high speed, or served as laser blasters or magnetic clamps.

Director Don Chaffey's last feature film was this family-oriented comedy about a robotic or computerized bionic dog - a spoof of crime fighting gadgetry and corrupt business executives. The film, with animated opening credits, got its title from the acronym for the mechanical dog, C.H.O.M.P.S. (Canine HOMe Protection System). It borrowed on the popularity of two popular movies at the time, Benji (1974) and the TV series and movie The Six Million Dollar Man (1973). The film's cute tagline was: ""When it comes to home security, he's the top dog!"" Another tagline stated: ""He's a super canine computer - the world's great crime fighter (crossed out and replaced with BITER)!"" This film was the first of a proposed film deal with Hanna-Barbera and American International Pictures (AIP) but when the picture failed at the box-office, the deal ended. The bionic dog (Benji), invented by 23 year-old Brian Foster (Wesley Eure), was based upon Brian's own scruffy pet Rascal (also Benji). He was a genius robotics-electronics worker at Norton Security Systems, a company producing devices to protect homes from invasion and prevent crime. The dog's special abilities included X-ray vision, super-strength, an ability to leap high distances, and vicious behavior (jumping through windows or walls, for example) after detecting a crime. Brian was trying to impress his boss Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain) and reestablish his job at the failing company. He was saved when the CEO's daughter Casey Norton (Valerie Bertinelli), his secret fiancee, came to his rescue. Most of the plot was about a rival company, headed by greedy Mr. Gibbs (Jim Backus), who had hired corporate spy Ken Sharp (Larry Bishop) to steal company secrets. The agent also employed two inept, bumbling and clumsy crooks, Bracken (Red Buttons) and Brooks (Chuck McCann), to steal the dog. The film ended with the demise of Mr. Gibbs, the capture of the criminals stealing plans, the near death of CHOMPS, and the manufacture of many more CHOMPS.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/chomps.jpg,0,neg,0

Wells' 1933 futuristic novel, and a remake (self-declared ""sequel"") of the earlier 1936 movie. It was really an entirely different story with different characters and settings, and very similar to Battlestar Gallactica (1978) and the TV series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979-1981). It was another weak attempt to duplicate the success of George Lucas' Star Wars phenomenon and ride the wave. The rip-off film reinterpreted the novel and speculated that the future, dystopic, high-tech world, unsurprisingly, would have spaceships, laser beams, and of course, evil robots. In the story, a nuclear apocalypse (""Robot Wars"") and Earth's devastation by pollution had caused its inhabitants to move to the Moon, and live in an insulating, glass-like, domed bubble. The occupants of New Washington were threatened by radioactive rays, and required drug medication (Radic-Q2) to survive radiation sickness. Unfortunately, the medicine was in the hands of evil, blackmailing, tyrannical Emperor Omus (Jack Palance) (known as ""The Robot Master""), always wearing a giant golden medallion attached to a flowing purple cape, who controlled distant planet Delta Three where the life-saving drug was manufactured. In the film's opening, he deliberately crashed a drug cargo spaceship (piloted by a robot) into the dome. A group of rebels ventured to his planet in an advanced starship (the Star Streak), assisted by Delta Three's female leader Nikki (Carol Lynley) to defeat Omus and save humanity by procuring more medication: Dr. John Caball (Barry Morse), science advisor, suffering and dying from radiation poisoning Jason (Nicholas Campbell), Caball's son Kim (Eddie Benton/Anne-Marie Martin), the daughter of colony leader Senator Smedley (John Ireland) ""Sparks"" (Mark Parr, voice by Greg Swanson), was Kim's reconditioned robot that emitted sparks at random. Sparks was reconstructed from the spare parts of the robot destroyed in the freighter crash.

Its title was a spoof on the acronym UFO (""Unidentified Flying Object""). The simplistic movie was billed as a ""sixth century space adventure."" A quirky NASA astronaut and robot-maker Tom Trimble (Dennis Dugan), due to an accident on the launch pad during an electrical storm, sent both his own doppelganger double, a trusty android robot pilot named Hermes (also Dugan) - and HIMSELF, back in time in his faster-than-light spacecraft Stardust. The space shuttle traveled to the Dark Middle Ages, landing in Cornwall, Devonshire England in 508 AD, at the time of King Arthur's Camelot, where he was captured. While romancing pretty Alisande (Sheila White), he was also compelled to save Camelot from villainous knight Sir Mordred (Jim Dale), who was conspiring to oust King Arthur (Kenneth More), and he would also expose magician Merlin (Ron Moody) as fraudulent.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/ufo4.jpg,0,neg,2

The android's living, organic brain (stored in a glass tank) was reprogrammed by drug-using, lustful psychotic pilot Benson (Harvey Keitel) who used a plug-in jack at the back of his neck (surgically implanted into his spinal cord) to control the robot's actions - mostly to rape Alex (he had earlier asked her: ""You have a great body.

78,,Clash of the Titans ,1981,"Clash of the Titans (1981) Bubo Director Desmond Davis' spirited, old-fashioned romantic adventure with a big-name cast was based upon ancient Greek mythology - the tale of Greek hero Perseus. It was the last feature film of special-effects, stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen, and his only film in the post-Star Wars era. He displayed impressive effects, however: a two-headed dog-wolf, a giant vulture, three giant scorpions, Pegasus the flying horse, Medusa the Gorgon with hair of snakes (and a stony glare), and the mechanical owl creature named Bubo. Bubo was a chirping, cute metallic golden owl that sounded like R2-D2 - essential to the film if it was to appeal to juveniles who had seen Star Wars (1977) with its two robotic droids. Its chirping sounded like a cuckoo-clock's bird. With spinning eyes, and a rotating head, its beak moved when it spoke. To overcome numerous obstacles in his quest, Perseus was aided by elderly poet/playwright Ammon (Burgess Meredith), and by a gift from Athena - she had instructed Hephaestus (Pat Roach) to build a golden replica of her pet owl Bubo. When Bubo flew to Perseus to assist him, Ammon asked about Bubo's speaking: ""Do you understand all those clicks and wheezes?"" Perseus affirmed that he did: ""Perfectly clear to me."" Ammon replied: ""It's another gift from the gods, like the sword and the helmet."" The live-action family fantasy pitted Perseus (Harry Hamlin), the illegitimate mortal son of Zeus (Laurence Olivier) against a number of obstacles (magic including solving a deadly riddle, monsters including three flesh-eating witches of Stygian, and the gods). With a magical sword, invisibility helmet and shield, he strove to free imprisoned Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker) (and win her hand) from the giant sea monster known as the Kraken (the last of the powerful Titans).

Sex Robot The fantasy graphics of the adult-oriented, late 70s comic book Heavy Metal inspired this animated, exploitative pop-cult film of six sci-fi/erotica, inter-related episodic segments (interwoven and framed by another story). The tales were accompanied by heavy metal hard rock. The animation was rated R for violence, sex, nudity (animated!), profanity and vulgarity. The entire film told of an evil, glowing sentient green orb or meteorite, called the Loc-Nar, in inter-related vignettes. This was an 'adult' underground cartoon that was more adolescent and juvenile than anything else, with graphic, teen-oriented depictions of drugs, taboo-breaking sex, disrobing nude women (with large breasts) viewed as sex-objects, sex-toy robots, fantasy sword-and-scorcery, and gory violence. In the 5th segment, ""So Beautiful, So Dangerous,"" red-headed Pentagon secretary Gloria (voice of Alice Playten) had sex with a robot (voice of John Candy) after being kidnapped onto an alien ship.

He was carrying out illegal research (androids were outlawed on Earth). The film drew parallels to Rotwang's creation of the destructive ""Fake"" Maria in Metropolis (1927), with footage from the film. In his spare time, coming-of-age Max engaged in learning about 20th century humans by playing computer games, watching old movies, reading sex manuals, and listening to rock 'n' roll and soul music. In order to activate and complete a perfect, upgraded blonde-haired female android model named Cassandra-1 (Kendra Kirchner) that would render Max obsolete, Dr. Daniel needed the life essence of a real female. Android Max was worried that he would be deactivated: ""I'm to be phased out as soon as Cassandra's on her feet. Doctor'll probably turn me into a sprinkler-head for the greenhouse."" A runaway spaceship with three fugitives arrived and docked at the space station, including: escaped female convict Maggie (Brie Howard) Keller (Norbert Weisser) Mendes (Crofton Hardester), Maggie's lover Daniel wanted to use Maggie as a model and sex-electrical power source (Maggie incredulously said: ""You want to hook me up to this robot and stimulate me!"").

There were astounding scenes, such as a breathtaking, gladiatorial competitive race in an arena - the light cycle sequence between curved racing pods. In the story, computer programmer/hacker Kevin Flynn/Clu (Jeff Bridges) was literally transported ('digitalized'), by malevolent Master Control Program or ""MCP"" (voice of David Warner), into the grid-lined, neon-glowing, 3-D pixelized world inside an evil corporation's mainframe ENCOM computer, where programs lived and worked. When Kevin first took the arcade grip controls within the computer, he experimented with a Recognizer, a pursuit and attack vehicle. Recognizers functioned as lethal enforcers of the MCP's tyrannical rule, which took care of renegade programs by capturing them, or by 'stomping' on them and crushing them with its pylon legs. Literally, a Recognizer was a hovering, aerial security transport vehicle (with a central control cockpit for the crew and a passenger compartment) with two massive pylon legs, used by the MCP's army. With his user powers, Flynn accidentally reactivated a Recognizer craft, reassembled it (although one of its triangular pylon leg-foot supports fell off, causing navigation difficulties), and piloted it to another part of the system, where he crashed and destroyed it.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/tron.jpg,0,neg,3

In the story, trailer park-dwelling, teenaged Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) was an expert Starfighter video game player (""a record breaker"") - a way to escape his ordinary real-world life. In the arcade style space battle-game, he brilliantely defended ""the Frontier"" from ""Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada."" Due to his game prowess, he was approached by the game's inventor, Centauri (Robert Preston in his final film appearance), an alien-mentor who spoke about ""a matter of utmost importance."" Centauri wished to recruit Alex to participate in an inter-galactic battle, as the pilot of a Starfighter spacecraft known as the Gunstar. The game's conflict was now being fought in earnest in space. The Rylan Star League, headed by lizard-like Grig (Dan O'Herlihy), was in combat against wicked Kodan forces, led by traitorous Xur (Norman Snow). Alex was whisked away to the planet Rylos in a high-tech DeLorean-styled super-car (a spacecraft in disguise). During his absence, a substitute would take his place - an android duplicate doppelganger named Beta (also Lance Guest). Although at first Alex was reluctant to assist the intellstar battle and returned home, Beta and Centauri convinced Alex that the only way to save his family and Earth was to embrace his ability as a Starfighter and join the League. Beta spent most of his time hiding under the blankets in bed, and began to have difficulty with the impersonation (and trying to fit in and be human with trailer park friends and family), especially with Alex's girlfriend Maggie (Catherine Mary Stewart) and her romantic advances. [Note: Many scenes with the Beta character were shot after main filming was completed. It was determined that test audiences wanted more of Beta's ""fish out of water"" comic relief. In these added scenes to provide originality, however, it was obvious that Lance Guest was wearing a wig - to cover over the fact that he had cut his hair shorter by that time.]",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/laststarfighter2.jpg,0,neg,2

He was able to build a yellow, round-headed, semi-autonomous robot that he named Bee Bee (voice of Charles Fleischer), designed with an AI microchip. Later in the plot, evil, crochety, shotgun-wielding neighbor Elvira Parker (Anne Ramsey) killed Bee Bee with a blast. When Paul's next-door neighbor girlfriend Samantha Pringle (16 year-old Kristy Swanson in her first major role) suffered brain-death wounds from her abusive father Harry (Richard Marcus), Paul implanted Bee Bee's microchip into her brain to reanimate her. Now with dark circles around her eyes and a zombie-like 'deadly' stare, Samantha had vision (seen from her point-of-view) and superhuman strength. She subsequently went on a vengeful murderous rampage, first killing her father, and then she avenged herself against neighbor Elvira by a swift, decapitating basketball-toss to the head. When pursued by police, Samantha also picked up motorcycle gang punk-bully Carl (Andrew Roperto) with two hands above her head, and tossed him into the windshield of a police car. Shortly later, Samantha (who was appearing to become more human) took a policeman's bullet meant for Paul to save his life. In the shock ending set in a morgue, Samantha grabbed Paul's neck as her outer skin was stripped away from her face and arms. She entreated him to join her: Bee Bee: ""Paul, come with me, Paul."" Paul: ""NO!"" As the film ended, his neck was snapped, and Samantha was transformed into a more evil and psychotic version of Bee Bee. The evil android had been growing inside of her all along.

The tagline stated: ""Mandroid. Mercenary. Scientist. Ninja. Each one a specialist. Together they are ELIMINATORS!"" However, ""Eliminators"" was a mis-nomer, although it rhymed with the blockbuster hit Terminator (1984). There was an unofficial spin-off called Mandroid (1993). In the plot, time traveling experiments were being conducted by megalomaniacal scientist Abbott Reeves (Roy Dotrice) in a hidden fortress within the jungles of Mexico, with his evil henchman Ray (Peter Schrum), and assistant Dr. Takada (Tad Horino). He had constructed a half-human, half-cyborg amnesiac named Mandroid (Patrick Reynolds), whose invincibility meant he was making the frequent time-travel trips. Reeves' crazed plot was to go back in time and become the Emperor of Rome, in order to rule the world.

97,R.A.L.F. Max,Flight of the Navigator ,1986,"Flight of the Navigator (1986) Max, and a robotic assistant named R.A.L.F. (or Robotic Assistant Labor Facilitator) This light-hearted Disney science-fiction, fantasy adventure film from director Randal Kleiser was designed for young audiences, and to appeal to those who enjoyed E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) (it even borrowed the phrase: ""Phone home""). It told about 12 year-old David Freeman (Joey Cramer) living in Florida in the late 1970s, who was knocked unconscious and reportedly abducted on the night of July 4th by an alien spaceship in a ravine near his home. When he awoke from unconsciousness, eight years had passed since he was reported as missing. David hadn't aged, and according to police reports, he had been declared legally dead in the interim. He was reunited with his parents Helen (Veronica Cartwright) and Bill Freeman (Cliff De Young) and younger brother Jeff (Matt Adler) who were now 8 years older, and had moved to a different address. David was taken to a maximum-security NASA research facility where he was tested by Dr. Louis Faraday (Howard Hesseman), and tended by pretty intern Carolyn McAdams (Sarah Jessica Parker) with her robotic assistant R.A.L.F. As she explained: ""He delivers mail, supplies, and he messes up a little bit every now and then."" RALF was a large boxy robot on wheels with a thin mail slot in front, and a rotating yellow beacon on top. NASA scientists determined (through brain scans) that during the alien abduction, David had been taken to a distant planet named Phaelon, 560 light years away on a 2.2 Earth-hour trip (an 8-year trip in terms of Einstein's theory of relativity). They discovered that he had served as ""Navigator"" on the advanced spaceship during the journey, with star charts in his head. At the same time, a similar spaceship crashed into an electrical tower, and NASA claimed it was one of their spacecraft, although it was the alien UFO. Schematics in David's head were for the crashed spacecraft just discovered. Realizing he was being confined and lied to by the experimenters, David escaped from the facility (by hiding in the robot R.A.L.F.) when summoned by the hidden flying saucer spacecraft. He boarded it and took off, again commanding the UFO after realizing that the special data placed in his head made him its 'Navigator.' The ship's computerized AI (artificial intelligence) or life-form called itself ""Trimaxion Drone Ship"" - shortened to the name Max. Pee Wee Herman's Paul Reubens served as the wise-cracking, robotic voice of the crashed spaceship's computer, with a periscope-like extension, that guided the spacecraft and befriended David. Through a mind transfer, Max wanted the star charts in David's head to complete his mission and return to Phaelon. Meanwhile, Max learned various human colloquialisms of the time: If you wanna learn how to swim, you have to jump in the water. Don't forget to feed Bruiser. Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun...That dumb dog will never learn to catch a frisbee. You are the inferior species, you dumb dork!...Scuz-bucket! Ha-ha!...See ya later, Navigator.

The military robots were known as S-A-I-N-T (Strategic-Artificially-Intelligent-Nuclear-Transport). One of the five wheeled killing machines with deadly lasers was struck by lightning during recharging - a symbolic act of creation. It came alive with a conscience and pleasant personality. It now had a pacifist outlook on life with no desire to kill (or ""disassemble""). Since the robot was ""Number 5"" in the series, it was renamed Johnny 5 (voice of Tim Blaney) - after hearing the song: ""Who's Johnny"" (performed by El DeBarge). It was an endearing, adorable, sophisticated drone-robot possessed of a processor made of gold. It went AWOL with the assistance of animal-loving protector Stephanie (Ally Sheedy). It quickly learned lots of information and pop cultural trends by speed-reading dictionaries and encyclopedias, and by watching television. It could soon imitate Saturday Night Fever's dancing John Travolta as well as cook in the kitchen.

Jinx had a tripod of wheeled feet and a projecting head with light. After Max repaired Jinx when the service-robot was sabotaged by the Green Team, Max and Jinx became ""friends for-e-ver."" Jinx overheard Max offhandedly speak about his wish to be in space, and interpreted his words literally - the robot had a chance to launch the entire team into space orbit by causing a ""thermal curtain failure"" when they were in the cockpit of the Atlantis shuttle during a test firing of the rocket boosters. After a series of emergencies in space including a spacewalk, a serious lack of oxygen, and lack of radio contact, the team landed the shuttle safely at White Sands in New Mexico. The quirky robot saved the day when it recognized the distress signal by the stranded juvenile crew via telemetry as Morse code (""C-O-M-E-I-N-C-O-N-T-R-O-L... Max's Code!"").

As the cab sped away amidst gunfire, the robot comically cautioned: ""Fasten your seat belt."" When Quaid escaped and left the cab, the robot chirped: ""The fare is 18 credits, please,"" to which Quaid responded: ""Sue me, dickhead,"" causing the robot to flare up and run the cab into a wall to create a fiery explosion - a defense mechanism to prevent unpaid fares.

It was set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit, Michigan. In the futuristic story, The OCP (Omni Consumer Products) Corporation had redevelopment plans to construct a new Delta City, to replace the old, low-income Cadillac Heights ghetto area. They secretly created a team of armed mercenaries, known as the Urban Rehabilitation Officers (the ""Rehabs""), under the command of Commander Paul McDaggett (John Castle), to clear out, evict and relocate the current poor residents. OCP's excuse was that they were helping to decrease crime in the area, and assisting the Detroit Police Department. The Rehabs began to take over the city and its police force, with strong financial backing from its CEO, Kanemitsu (Mako), of the Japanese Kanemitsu Corporation. A ninja humanoid-android (known as ""Otomo"") (Bruce Locke) was constructed, an assassin with a steel-cutting sword (katana), to reinforce the efforts of McDaggett and OCP's new president (Rip Torn) to overcome armed, revolutionary (underground) resistance from anti-OCP militia forces. McDaggett kept two more Otomo droids in his OCP Tower just in case. [Note: Otomo referred to a series of androids manufactured by the Kanemitsu Corporation. They were the Japanese version of The Terminator. They had super-strength, speed and reflexes, and could do flips and triple somersaults. They were designed with a safety feature, which if they were defeated, would detonate a miniature nuclear device.] The rebel forces were led by Japanese-American computer whiz Nikko Halloran (Remy Ryan) and other residents of Cadillac Heights. In the middle of the conflict, mechanical humanoid RoboCop/Alex J. Murphy (Robert John Burke) attempted to protect civilians in Cadillac Heights from being murdered by the Rehabs, but was also taking orders from the OCP. When RoboCop's partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) was mortally wounded by McDaggett, he vowed to avenge her death by fighting against the Rehabs and OCP (and its recruited Splatterpunks), and their Otomo droid assassin-robots. In his first confrontation with Otomo, a spectacular ninja fight scene, RoboCop was punched and kicked. He warned Otomo: RoboCop: ""Detroit police. Identify yourself. You are under arrest for assaulting an officer."" (RoboCop reached for his arm-mounted Auto-9 machine gun, but Otomo knocked it away and cut off RoboCop's four fingers.) ""And destruction of police property."" After his left hand was entirely severed to the elbow, RoboCop fired a missile from his arm-mounted gun which decapitated Otomo in a fiery, sparking explosion. After RoboCop was reprogrammed and retrofitted by renegade scientist Dr. Marie Lazarus (Jill Hennessy), and equipped with a jet-pack, he began to combat OCP and their Otomo cyborg-ninjas. In the concluding conflict in the OCP building, RoboCop fought against McDaggett and two more Otomo robots. Nikko and Dr. Lazarus reprogrammed the two androids, forcing them to destroy each other (and detonate their self-destruct mechanisms).

It was a Hitchcock-inspired mystery-thriller. It featured eccentric and slightly daft Wallace's latest invention -- a pair of ex-NASA automated, robotic or mechanical trousers (""techno-trousers"") outfitted with suction feet. They were given as a birthday gift to Gromit, Wallace's silent anthropomorphic dog. They would alleviate Wallace's tiresome duties of taking Gromit for a walk - as an automated dog-walker (""fantastic for walkies"").

On his first walk, Gromit cleverly attached his leash to a stuffed dog on a rolling cart. Wallace rented a bedroom out to an evil silent penguin named Feathers McGraw, who modified the trousers with a detached remote control mechanism.

(""Advanced Prototype EXploration Units""), and APEX Sterilization Units Writer/director Phillip Roth's action sci-fi film was a post-apocalyptic time travel film (with a time paradox storyline) - another clone of the Terminator films. Time exploration was being conducted by robotic Advanced Prototype EXploration (A.P.E.X.) units, sent from a research facility, the Datatron Research Center in Los Angeles, to the past. To eliminate the possibility of creating a time paradox, only machines were allowed to time-travel. One of the problems with exploring time was that a time-traveling unit could become infected with a virus, if it came into contact with humans. Scientist Dr. Nicholas Sinclair (Richard Keats), in the year 2073, was supervising a routine mission to the eastern part of the Mohave Desert, 100 years in the past, by an APEX unit that was programmed to enter the time portal. Sinclair narrated: ""April 3rd, 2073. We were about to launch a probe one hundred years into the past. Whatever happened that day, nothing in my life would ever be the same."" A civilian family (Robert Tossberg and Kathy Lambert) on vacation (towing a trailer-camper), and their son Joey (Kareem H. Captan) in particular, came into contact with the APEX unit, thereby breaching the time line. Automatic self-destruct counter-measures were activated by Sinclair's lab, to eliminate the APEX unit, but they failed. A second line of defense was the deployment or triggering of an APEX sterilization unit. It was a hunter/killer robot (with optical sensors) armed with shoulder-mounted mini-rocket launchers and hand-mounted pulse cannons to prevent virus infection, sent from Sinclair's laboratory to eliminate the human threat. Dr. Sinclair disobeyed strict protocol to save the family from the threatening APEX sterilization unit, by entering the portal himself and traveling back to 1973. He found that the APEX unit had successfully self-destructed, but injured the boy in close proximity. It was feared that the newly-sent APEX sterilization unit would eliminate both the family - and Dr. Sinclair. The lab was sealed and powered down, and Dr. Sinclair's status was declared as ""unknown."" Back in 1973, Sinclair and the family were targeted by the relentless APEX sterilization unit, but Sinclair helped them to escape, although their trailer was blown up. Sinclair entered back through the time portal to his present year of 2073, in an alternate timeline. As a result of the time paradox, he found a post-apocalyptic Earth of 2073 ravaged by decades of genocidal war, a killer virus, and attacks by the relentless killer robots (sterilization units) over 100 years. The resulting time paradox had created an endless loop where sterilization units were continuously sent into the past one after the other. Remnants of humans included scattered Marines and various scavengers, all threatened by the randomly-appearing APEX machines. Sinclair was recognized as one of the soldiers. In order to resolve the issue, Sinclair had to find his derelict research lab in order to unravel what happened one hundred years in the past, to unlock the paradox he created, and prevent the original probe (that caused the problem) from being sent.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/apex3.jpg,0,neg,2

The Terridax used a giant, towering steel robot called Tsu Garu to subjugate the people.

139,Solo Solo II,Solo ,1996,"Solo (1996) Solo and Solo II This sci-fi action thriller was based on the 1989 novel Weapon by Robert Mason. Mario Van Peebles starred as Solo - a robotic android killing machine manufactured for the military (known as Project Solo), to be sent as a cyber-soldier to battle Central American rebel insurgents who were setting up a remote airstrip (to destabilize a friendly regime). Costing $2 billion, the bald and muscle-bound Solo (with a face ""like Mike"" -- modeled after basketball star Michael Jordan) was constructed of polymers and computer chips, equipped with motion-sensors, and night-time vision (and ""virtually immune to small-arms fire...about 15 times stronger, 10 times faster than any man""). He was ""proficient in all types of combat"" - ""it's not just the weapon, he can make decisions!"" Due to programming flaws or a ""glitch,"" Solo was uncharacteristically self-aware (and human) during the aborted mission-raid (realizing that there were women and children non-combatants in the line of fire), and opposed his ruthless and obsessive Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler). Solo eventually escaped by hijacking a helicopter and joined the side of the rebel peasants in the jungle, where he exchanged his protection for energy to power himself, due to a damaged power supply. The surprise toward the end of the film was that a more powerful, unflawed and highly-developed version of Solo, a super cyborg prototype named Solo MKII (""the model for the next generation"") (also William Sadler), appeared with the face of Colonel Madden! He was in charge of pursuing the aberrant, malfunctioning android in order to recover it or destroy it.",http://www.filmsite.org/robots/solo.jpg,2,neg,0
140,Borg Soldier Borg Queen Entrance,Star Trek: First Contact ,1996,"Star Trek: First Contact (1996) The Borg and the Borg Queen The second Star Trek: The Next Generation film featured the TV series' fearsome cyborg gestalt - the villainous, nearly invincible and ruthless Borg, whose mission was to absorb or assimilate all other species or cultures into their collective consciousness (""We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own""). Their catchphrase was: ""Resistance is futile."" Captured android Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) was threatened with the words: ""You are an imperfect being, created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time."" The film then introduced the character of the sexy, cunning Borg Queen (Alice Krige), whose plan was to use time travel to enslave Earth's humanity in the 21st century (the year 2063). Her memorable entrance featured her organic head, shoulders and spinal cord descending from the ceiling and latching onto her synthetic, artificial body, as she announced: Are you ready?...I am the Borg... I am the beginning, the end, the one who is many. I am the Borg...I am the Collective ...By assimilating other beings into our Collective, we are bringing them closer to perfection. She attempted a seduction by grafting organic, human flesh onto Data's arm (she assisted him in his goal to become more fully human) and the promise of having sex with him (""Are you familiar with physical forms of pleasure?"" to which he replied: ""I am fully functional. Programmed in multiple techniques"") in order to have him surrender encryption codes that would allow her to take over the USS Enterprise. Attempting to save Data, USS Enterprise Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) located Data and was confronted by the Borg Queen (""You were very close, you and I...Welcome home, Locutus""). Picard offered himself in exchange for Data's freedom (""I will take my place at your side""), but the android refused to leave (""I do not wish to go""). Commanded by the Queen, Data deactivated the Enterprise's self-destruct sequence, entered encryption codes to allow her control of the vessel, and then aimed the Enterprise's quantum torpedoes at the Phoenix during its historic flight -- but the missiles didn't hit their target. The loyal android had deceived and betrayed the Borg Queen and turned on her - he ironically warned her: ""Resistance is futile,"" and then killed her with flesh-eating vapor-gas from a smashed coolant tube. When she fell into the corrosive gas, it liquefied her organic parts on contact, rendering her into a twitching, lifeless skull and spinal cord. The remainder of the Borgs under her command were also neutralized when she perished. Picard went over to her metal-skeletal remains, pulled off the upper part of her skull and spinal cord, and snapped her spinal cord with his bare hands (causing the flickering red lights to be extinguished).",http://www.filmsite.org/fotos/firstcontact9.jpg,0,neg,2

One of its characters was female mechanic Annalee Call (Winona Ryder) - a young, mercenary inter-stellar smuggler from the freight cargo spaceship Betty who was in a group that delivered contraband cargo of hijacked bodies in hypersleep to experimental military scientists on the deep-space military research vessel the USM Auriga. She was first described by Betty's captain Frank Elgyn (Michael Wincott) as a ""little girl playing pirates...she is severely f--kable."" Recognizing who Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was - a cloned, bionic superhumanly strong warrior queen named clone # 8, Call first attempted to kill her (""You're a thing, a construct. They grew you in a f--king lab. And now they brought it out of you"") - she wanted to ""stop this thing before it gets loose,"" but Ripley told her: ""It's too late. You can't stop it. It's inevitable."" Call rightly feared that the scientists were spawning adult aliens from Ripley's recently-extracted alien child (she said they were conducting ""illegal experiments... breeding an alien species""). Ultimately, Call was revealed to be a robot (""a new model droid""), when shot directly in the chest but unharmed as the newly-grown aliens attacked while surviving crew members attempted to escape. Ripley said this about Call's robot nature: ""I should have known. No human being is that humane."" Upon realizing her synthetic nature, alien-infected Purvis (Leland Orser) quipped: ""Great. She's a toaster oven."" In the exciting conclusion, when Call was threatened by a half-Alien, half-human, skull-faced ""Newborn"" hybrid alien creature (a ""beautiful butterfly"") that tagged along on the departing Betty, Ripley saved Call by causing the monster to be sucked out through one of the windows into space. Upon arriving safely on Earth with Ripley, Call commented: ""It's beautiful. I didn't expect it to be.""",http://www.filmsite.org/robots/alienresurrection.jpg,0,neg,0

Scott, Barbara Ann Moore, and Cynthia Lamontagne). The remote-controlled Fembots (introduced with Nancy Sinatra's singing of ""These Boots Were Made For Walking""), were beautiful blonde android replicants, wearing white boots, plastic raincoats, and silver two piece outfits. They were described as: ""The latest word in android replicant technology. Lethal, Efficient, Brutal. No man can resist their charms."" They were designed as the ""ultimate weapon"" by Dr. Evil's (Mike Myers) henchwoman Frau Fraubissina (Mindy Sterling) to conquer Austin Powers (also Myers). They had protruding gunbarrels that emerged from their bikini-covered breasts [the Fembots' brassieres were based on the one worn by Ursula Andress in the cult Italian sci-fi movie The 10th Victim (1965)]. The three Fembots demonstrated their lethal breast-weapons on five emasculated guards - moving from left to right to vary the projectile of the bullets fired from each breast. One of the Fembots blew air at her gun nozzles to cool them off. Dr. Evil quipped: ""Very impressive. I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, of course, I mean, both the size of their gun barrels, and the high quality of their characters..."" In an underground lair in a later sequence, the Fembots wore purple fuzzy teddy-bear nightgowns to entice Austin Powers - they asked him: ""Care to have a little fun?"" - one of them jumped onto his shoulders and gripped his neck with her thighs, while the others protruded tubes from their breasts (called ""jumblies,"" British slang for breasts). He joked about their nipples: ""Is it cold in here?"" as they sprayed him with a pink-colored gas, to put him to sleep and distract him for battling Dr. Evil. FemBots FemBots Powers found himself lying in bed with the Fembots, who stroked him to tantalize him, as he attempted to think of distracting things: ""Baseball, cold showers...Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day..."" When Powers tried to flee, two Fembots blocked his way and challenged him: ""You can't resist us, Mr. Powers,"" although he knew better: ""Au contraire, baby."" To fight them off, he performed an irresistible sexy strip-tease dance (down to Union Jack red underwear and hairy chest) to the tune of ""I Touch Myself."" His gyrations caused them to short-circuit with sexual electricity as their heads twitched violently and then exploded. Powers explained later how he defeated the Fembots with machine-gun boobs: ...all of a sudden, the Fembots came by and smoke started to come out of their jumblies. So I'd thought I'd work my mojo, right, to counter their mojo. We got cross-mojonations, and their heads started exploding.

Weebo with a female persona (voice of Jodi Benson, and puppeteered by Robert Cooper) was absent-minded Philip's hovering robot assistant, who helped him to create the miraculous polymer. It was a bouncing green goo called Flubber. Weebo was responsible for naming the substance, when she called it ""flying rubber"" - and it was shortened as ""FLUBBER."" At times, Flubber became anthropomorphic and sentient, could imitate human behavior, and terrorize everyone as a mischievous little green tormenter. Weebo, a saucer-shaped computer mostly yellow in color but also black and gray, could take pictures with a pop-up flash camera, or playback 'old movies' on its curved pop-up LCD screen to express her feelings (i.e, Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942), Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Dumbo (1941), and Mickey Rooney in Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938)). Weebo was adorable and in love with Brainard, and expressed jealous tendencies. She also made a holographic projection in the form of a human spirit named Sylvia. There were two other robotic characters in the storyline: Weber, Professor Brainard's house-robot who would do house-cleaning chores Weebette (voice of Julie Morrison), the ""daughter"" of Weebo (after Weebo's destruction) The main plot was that the professor's rivals, scientist Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald) and greedy businessman Chester Hoenicker (Raymond Barry) unsuccessfully tried to steal Flubber. In the film's conclusion, Weebo was hit by a baseball bat while trying to protect Flubber. Weebo had shouted her challenging final words to the two thieves as she was shattered into pieces: ""Kiss me, big boy."" After Weebo ceased to function and faced her demise, Brainard asked: ""What happens to the soul of a machine?"" Weebo was able to provide Brainard with full and complete blueprints of herself (with flaws removed) to produce her daughter, Weebette.

The action was set in the year 2058, with a dying Earth threatened by ecological disaster. The United Global Space Force sent the Robinson Family (loosely based on Swiss Family Robinson) into outerspace. The family was headed by Jupiter Mission lead scientist Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), and included: wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) daughter Judy (Heather Graham) teenaged Penny (Lacey Chabert) 10-year-old Will (Jack Johnson) The family was on a ten-year mission (in a state of suspended animation) on the Jupiter II spaceship to find a refuge at a habitable planet called Alpha Prime. Terrorist organization Global Sedition's trapped and unwilling stowaway spy Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) found himself unconscious and on the launched mission. He had re-programmed and changed the ""primary directives"" of the ""platinum-plated pal"" (voice of Dick Tufeld, the original robot's voice), which cried out ""Warning! Warning!"" The mission's robot became a Cyclops-eyed, 8-foot tall robot - a destructive fighting machine onboard the ship. It reiterated its directive: ""Sixteen hours into mission, Destroy Robinson Family. Destroy all systems."" Smith added: ""Give my regards to oblivion."" Dr. Smith's attempt to sabotage the flight by destroying the ship using the robot's laser rays and killing the crew failed when young boy genius Will Robinson was able to control the robot remotely, although the ship was sent off-course and became 'lost in space.' During their further journey, the family came upon carnivorous, heat-seeking, silicon-based killer spider-crab robots with large fangs, that also spewed blue blood, found on a ghostly, abandoned spaceship named the Proteus.

This film was also set in a futuristic theme park, a place where visitors could interact with androids, but in this case as film noir detectives against violent gangsters in a 1930s-1940s mob setting. Many of the character names were those of actors from 1940s film noirs, for example, Garland Widmark, Lita Hayworth, Dr. Greenstreet, Astor, Rains, Houston, Ladd, and two thugs Rath and Bone, etc. The film's tagline was: ""Lust, greed and violence...welcome to the future."" Vampish android gun moll Astor (supermodel Stacey Williams), the main squeeze of Lorre (Will Leong), spouted lines such as: ""How about a tumble before the rumble?"", and ""Take me with you lover, I'm really good in a tight squeeze."" The time period and locale was L.A. in the year 2028. The interactive Gangster World theme park was created by Dr. Greenstreet (David Leisure), as a way to decrease crime (""the civilized way to cope with violence""). Robotic Carbon Units or RCUs (part-human androids) populated the park, and were programmed to not hurt humans. Genius software designer Garland Widmark (Gabriel Dell, Jr.) was hired by Greenstreet to make the park fully-automated. On the eve of the park's grand re-opening when a new master computer (named Donald 3000) went online, there was a major homicidal disaster, possibly the result of sabotage. An assassinator android known as the mysterious Outsider (Adam Kendrick) appeared. He was programmed to kill - and soon human park guards were slain. It was possible that a mysterious Kingpin was behind the malfunctions, or the park's militaristic security head Alan Houston (Lindsay Lee Ginter). When going to investigate inside the park, Widmark's blonde co-worker and romantic interest Lita Hayworth (Bridget Flanery) was abducted and held hostage by android mobsters. Widmark was forced to try and rescue her - although he too was marked for assassination by the Outsider.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/outsider.jpg,0,neg,2

The film was soundly criticized for an assault of numerous product placements. Meek security guard John Brown (Broderick Crawford), employed at Riverton Ohio's Bradford Laboratories, always dreamed of becoming a law-enforcing police officer. He also had a romantic interest in boss Dr. Artemus Bradford's (Rene Auberjonois) scientist daughter Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher). During the pursuit of a theft of a mechanical foot, stolen by soon-to-be arch-villain and robotics billionaire Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) during a break-in at the lab (that killed Artemus), Brown was badly injured in an explosion. Scolex lost his left hand from a bowling ball falling on his hand after the explosion. (He replaced his hand with a large metal Claw, that became his new nickname: ""Just Claw, one word... like Madonna""). Similar to the RoboCop films and the The Six Million Dollar Man, Brown was rebuilt by Brenda as a prototype police officer cyborg - a technological bionic man newly-named Inspector Gadget (Crawford). Brown was initially confused by his new persona (""I'm not me any more, I'm a hardware store""). Police Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) quipped: ""Columbo and Nintendo all rolled into one."" He was dressed with a khaki raincoat, black necktie, and hat - the Gadget Suit, and a mantra of magic words (""Go-go Gadget -- ""), which when spoken would invoke a crime detection device (a helicopter, oil-slick, etc.), or cause his body to sprout tools: springs in his shoes' soles and rollerblades appliances from his fingers his body could inflate into an airbag hands that sprayed toothpaste hat that turned into a helicopter stretched arms and legs, that could turn into elongated steel stilts He also had a talking car with AI, named Gadget-mobile (voice of D.J.

It's bad to kill, but it's not bad to die...You're made of metal, but you have feelings, and you think about things, and that means you have a soul. And souls don't die.

It had a similar plot-line retelling Disney's Pinocchio about a search of a puppet to become a real boy and find real love. Through irreversible imprinting, David believed he was capable of real emotion and unconditional love toward his adoptive mother Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) and father Henry Swinton (Sam Robards), although when their real son Martin (Jake Thomas) recovered from a state of suspended animation, David was eventually abandoned. Rather than being returned to Cybertronics for destruction, David was forced to take a long journey to become ""real"" by encountering the ""Blue Fairy"" (a submerged Coney Island statue, actually) from the Pinocchio tale.

157,Tima,Metropolis ,2001,"Metropolis (2001, Jp.) Tima This Japanese anime film by director Rintaro was ultimately inspired by Fritz Lang's classic silent film of the same name, Metropolis (1927, Germ.), with some resemblances to Dark City (1998) and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982). The movie was scripted by writer-director Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira (1988, Jp.)), who was working from the 1949 manga comic created by the father of modern Japanese manga (or ""father of anime"") - Osamu Tezuka, who was also the creator of the comic series Astroboy. Although the film excelled in its dazzling visuals and animation, its plot was often slow-paced and dull with undeveloped characters. The story was set in the futuristic city of Metropolis, in which both robots and humans lived but not entirely in peaceful co-existence - separated by levels and/or societal segments. Robots - considered downtrodden second-class citizens, lived in a segregated, underground world, while humans lived the good life. The city was ruled by a conniving industrialist known as Duke Red (Tar___ Ishida). The rich, ambitious megalomaniacal industrialist had hired rebellious scientist-genius, Dr. Laughton (Junpei Takiguchi), to create a perfect robot girl for him - an innocent mecha-girl named Tima (Yuka Imoto). She was modeled after Red's own deceased daughter. Laughton bragged to Duke Red about his invention (to be completed by the end of the week), with only her fuel-management systems still unstable: ""I never use human body parts. They don't last very long anyway, you know, quick fix at best. She's 100% synthetic. Much better. Every component made by hand. She's a masterpiece - the culmination of my life's work...If I try to activate her any sooner than that, the fuel cells might overload and that could spell disaster. She could literally blow up - boom, just like that."" Duke Red's intent was to have Tima, the ultimate robot android ""superhuman "" (created to be his powerful weapon) sit atop his massive skyscraper known as the Ziggurat (a Tower-of-Babel like structure) and rule the world from his throne. However, the devious and scheming Laughton was also secretly planning to leave Metropolis with his own invention, without ever handing it over to the Duke. Duke Red's heartless adopted son (an orphan), a jealously-protective young aide named Rock (K___ki Okada), headed up a vigilante group known as the Marduk Party, to put down any uprisings or rebellion (mostly anti-robot sentiment) by eliminating rogue robots. Following his own cold-blooded path, Rock lethally shot Dr. Laughton, and set his laboratory on fire, hoping to destroy both him and the robot - because of his profound jealousy: ""No mechanical puppet is going to steal my father's heart...I won't allow my father to be fooled by a robot"" - he vowed. His objective was to protect his father ""from the evil of machines."" Meanwhile, Japanese private detective Shunsaku Ban (K___sei Tomita) and his Tin-Tin-like sidekick nephew Kenichi (Kei Kobayashi) became involved when they went searching for rebel scientist Dr. Laughton, to seize his latest unfinished creation - Tima. Kenichi found himself on an odyssey with the incomplete robot girl (unaware of who she really was: ""Who am I?""), protecting her and teaching her to speak.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/metropolis2001-4.jpg,0,neg,2

However, it suffered possibly one of the largest financial losses (percentage-wise) ever recorded for a film -- approximately a 95% loss. The film's infantile and unfunny script was poorly executed and borrowed from lots of second-rate films. It was filmed episodically like a vintage action serial, was dwarfed by the inventive production values of the film's setting and special effects, and was often diluted by Eddie Murphy's familiar but sleepy and subdued characterization. The film was honored with five Razzie Award nominations: Worst Actor (Murphy), Worst Director, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple, and Worst Screenplay. It was also nominated in 2005 as the Worst 'Comedy' in 25 years of Razzie awards, losing to Gigli (2003). Its story was about an ex-smuggler and ex-con nightclub owner in space (on the Moon 239,000 miles from Earth) around the year 2087 named Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy). Nash had bought a bar from his lounge lizard Italian friend Tony (Jay Mohr) and turned it into a successful nightclub, known as Club Pluto (in the hip urban district of ""Little America"" - a lunar Las Vegas). He was pressured by demanding mobster goons (including Joe Pantoliano as thuggish hitman Mogan and Kelp (Victor Varnado)) to turn over his successful establishment for $10 million to reclusive and mysterious gangster kingpin Rex Crater. Crater resided in a penthouse at the swanky Lunar Grand Casino in the gambling city of Moon Beach. Crater wanted the club to be converted into a lucrative casino. When the mob blew up the nightclub and engaged in a laser-gun shootout, Nash became a fugitive with his new love interest: his own space-suited waitress and aspiring nightclub singer Dina Lake (Rosario Dawson) during her first visit to the Moon. For the remainder of the film, Nash sought to find out the identity of the mysterious magnate (Rex Crater) in order to seek revenge - in the film's spoiler, Nash's evil nemesis was revealed to be Pluto himself - a 7 year old clone. Nash was always joined by his outdated, hulking robot bodyguard named Bruno (Randy Quaid), an inferior Model 63 Deluxe android looking like a gray Frankenstein. With his shaved bald head, thick grease-pencil eyebrows, lumbering stride, and badly-stitched suit, the vintage Bruno with a Midwestern accent always had a smile on his face due to a happiness-chip implant.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/plutonash.jpg,10,neg,2
159,Spyder-Bots Blindfolded Anderton (Tom Cruise) Submerged in Tub of Ice Water Spyder-Bot Hovering Just Above Water Level,Minority Report ,2002,"Minority Report (2002) Spyder Robots Director Steven Spielberg's futuristic, sci-fi mystery thriller, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, was set in the year 2054. Pre-crime law enforcement used psychic 'precogs' who were submerged in flotation tanks to forecast and envision future crimes. However, it appeared that 'pre-crime' was a flawed system, because the three 'precogs' didn't always agree (a discrepancy in their visions would be written up - called a 'minority report' - the film's title). In a suspenseful set of sequences, Washington DC pre-crime cop Capt. John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who had misgivings about the 'pre-crime' system, was forced to become a fugitive (he was undoubtedly framed) when he was identified as the future killer of a person he didn't know - a person named Leo Crow. He kidnapped one of the precogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton) as he went on a quest to vindicate himself and locate the future victim. During a full-scale search, Anderton hid in a tub of ice water in a tenement building. One of the patrolling officers noted with a thermal scan that there were 28 warm bodies: ""I confirm 28 warm bodies... What do you think - four spiders, one per floor?"" Mechanical bot-spyders, with polywog-like spherical bodies with tails, were stored in each officer's belt with their legs retracted. They were released to swarm through the entire area, and to perform retinal scans on the tenants to determine identities from eyeballs - to find out whether Anderton was there or not. When Anderton emerged from the water and removed part of his blindfold, one of the spyder-bots scanned his retina. He knew he wouldn't be identified (""It's not him""), because he had just undergone eye replacement surgery. Spyder-Bots and Retinal Scans Spyder-Bots and Retinal Scans Spyder-Bots and Retinal Scans The film concluded with a twist, proving that Anderton had been framed within his own department. His corrupt pre-crime boss Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) was revealed to be the murderer of Agatha's mother Anne Lively (Jessica Harper). The motive for the drowning was because Anne, who had conquered her drug habit, had wanted to remove her fragile pre-cog daughter Agatha from the pre-crime flotation tanks. Threatened by the thought, Burgess wanted to prevent the shut-down of his sinister, futuristic law enforcement organization.

With a budget of $65 million, the sequel cost nearly three times what the first film did. In the first part of the story, divorced father Scott Calvin (Tim Allen in his feature film debut) was forced to take Santa's place when the red-costumed, white-bearded St. Nick fell off his roof. He assumed Kris Kringle's duties due to a legal requirement known as the ""Santa Clause."" In the sequel, 46 year-old Calvin had been on the job as Father Christmas for eight years. However, he learned that Christmas would disappear and he would lose his magical powers if he didn't find a suitable Mrs. Claus mate by the next Christmas Eve. Meanwhile back at his hometown, Scott's 16 year-old son Charlie Calvin (Eric Lloyd) was 'acting out' and becoming a discipline problem at school (and he had been put on the ""Naughty"" list). He was charged with vandalism - defacing with graffiti the walls and lockers of his school, presumably due to the prolonged absences of his father, and the added pressure for Charlie to keep his father's identity a secret. During Santa's search for a wife, a robotic duplicate, clone or doppelganger was created of Scott at the North Pole, dubbed the Toy Santa (also Tim Allen). This evil Toy Santa, a mean, life-sized plastic taskmaster outfitted in a military dictator's uniform, believed that every child was ""naughty,"" and the only gifts the next year would be lumps of coal. He announced to all of his dismayed workers: ""Stop the work...From this moment forward, we're not going to make any more toys. Children of the world don't deserve these presents. They're running rampant with naughtiness. So this Christmas, we're gonna give those greedy, selfish little kids exactly what they deserve. A beautiful, yet high-quality, low sulfur variety of coal."" He also revealed that he had created an army of life-size Toy Soldiers in his image: ""They don't have a good sense of humor, like me. I would do what they ask you, which is pretty much what I'm gonna tell ya."" The Fake Santa instituted a dictatorship during his coup d'etat, complete with enlarged Toy Soldiers marching around to enforce his will. Bernard (David Krumholtz), the head elf, protested, but to no avail when he was promptly arrested. Scott had romantic luck with Principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), and they became passionately and romantically involved with each other. However, he was forced to return to the North Pole and subdue the evil Toy Santa, who was wreaking havoc and about to destroy Christmas. The Toy soldiers were defeated during a final battle between their robot army and the Elves with snowballs, silly string and snowmobiles, and Toy Santa was reduced to his normal 6"" height.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/santaclause2.jpg,65,neg,2

During the filming of big-budget director Viktor Taransky's (Al Pacino) latest feature film titled Sunrise Sunset, the production was on the verge of collapse when his narcissistic and bitchy main star Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder) (""a supermodel with a SAG card"") walked off the set. He was also fired by his ex-wife Elaine (Catherine Keener) who was the studio head of Amalgamated Film.

Data (Brent Spiner) B-4's Head Before Reassembly Data Deactivating B-4 Data Saying Goodbye to Picard Last Scene: Picard with B-4,Star Trek Nemesis ,2002,"Star Trek Nemesis (2002) B-4 This Star Trek Next Generations film was the 10th feature film in the Star Trek franchise and the fourth and last of the Star Trek films to feature the main cast of the Star Trek: The Next Generation TV series. During the USS Enterprise's (NCC-1701-E) journey while it was being captained by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), a positronic signal was received from the Kolarun System and the desert-like third planet of Kolarus III. Android Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) surmised that the signal (coming from six different locations on the surface) could only be from an android (""a long-lost relative?"") made by Data's own creator - Dr. Noonien Soong. The Enterprise's shuttlecraft Argo landed and navigated the terrain in its auxiliary dune buggy, finding six disassembled body parts of a look-alike Data android - it was an earlier less-developed and less-advanced prototype named B-4. [Note: B-4 was one of the five other androids built by Dr. Soong before Lore and Data - effectively B-4 was Data's older brother.] The group returned to the ship with the six parts of the B-4 android (to be reassembled), not knowing that they had unknowingly introduced a spy by bringing the disparate parts of the 'planted' B-4 android onboard. Later on, Picard learned that the Enterprise's computers had been accessed. His main adversary, Praetor Shinzon (Tom Hardy) of Remus, had been able to obtain the disassembled B-4 and placed some special programming into him, so he could infiltrate the USS Enterprise-E to gain tactical information about the Federation from the ship. Both the B-4 android and Picard were transported over to Shinzon's ship, to download all of the B-4's information about Starfleet's communication protocols, and to restrain Picard (to take blood samples). Picard had been targeted by Shinzon because the Reman was dying of genetic degeneration and could only be restored with a complete blood transfusion from Picard (""the only donor with compatible DNA""). Shinzon had plans to conquer the Federation (""My life is meaningless as long as you're still alive... We are a race bred for war and conquest""). The story's turning point was the revelation that B-4 was actually being impersonated by Data. Data had deactivated B-4 for an indefinite period because of his potentially dangerous capabilities. Data was also able to release Picard as prisoner - and then he described how he had cleverly given the Remans false information. In the film's climactic struggle onboard the Reman's Scimitar, Shinzon's predatory Warbird spacecraft, Data self-sacrificially remained on the Scimitar to save all the others, and gave his own single-use personal transporter to Picard before saying goodbye. When the warship was blasted into oblivion, Data also lost his life. However, Data would live on. In Data's quarters, Picard realized that Data's prototype 'brother' B-4 probaby hadn't comprehended the loss or understood Data's desires to always want to be better - until B-4 began singing softly to himself the words to ""Blue Skies"": ""Never saw the sun...Never saw the sun..."" -- optimistically signifying that he had assimilated Data's memories successfully and would carry on after him. One day, Data would return.",http://www.filmsite.org/fotos/nemesis6.jpg,0,neg,2

(Bio-Electronic Navigator) Disney Pictures' attempted to provide an animated futuristic version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic 1883 literary novel Treasure Island -- also Disney's first all-live action feature film in 1950 with Bobby Driscoll and Robert Newton. This expensive film was targeted at family audiences (but would mostly appeal to tween boys, the reverse of the market targeted with its earlier effort Lilo & Stitch (2002)). Unfortunately for Disney, it was a very costly failure, although it was a landmark film -- it was the first film to debut in both the conventional and IMAX formats on the same day. This impressive and stunning animation drastically altered the traditional pirate-themed elements from the original, with the additions of space-wars components, a mythical planet and various space creatures. Its coming-of-age story about filial bonding, bravery and sacrifice told about a troubled, pony-tailed, earring-wearing teen with an attitude named Jim Hawkins (voice of Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who dreamed about a legendary planet called ""Treasure Planet."" There, treasure had been reportedly hidden by notorious ancient space pirate Captain Nathaniel Flint. With a 3-D holographic treasure map or star-chart issuing from a hand-held spherical orb in his possession, and a space vessel hired by goofy, canine-like family doctor/astrophysicist Doctor Delbert Doppler (voice of David Hyde Pierce from TV's Frasier), the two commenced an intergalactic quest-journey. On board the majestic space galleon RLS Legacy were these crew members: the ship's Captain Amelia (voice of Emma Thompson), a stern and feisty but slinky feline First Mate, Mr. Arrow (voice of Roscoe Lee Browne) the cook or galley master John Silver (voice of Brian Murray), a dangerously crafty, mutinous but charming cyborg with an ingenious Swiss Army Knife-like arm, a peg-leg, and a cyborg eye (with Zoom-in, Thermal vision, Night vision, and X-Ray capabilities) Silver's shape-shifting pet Morph (voice of Dane Davis), a cute cosmic pink blob Scroop (voice of Michael Wincott), a squinty-eyed, ruthless, traitorous and menacing alien spider-like insectoid On Treasure Planet itself (actually a large space station commandered by Captain Flint), the group of fugitive crew members met one of its strange space creatures - a malfunctioning, absent-minded, talkative, abandoned robot named B.E.N (voice of Martin Short) - the film's only fully CGI character (inspired by the novel's character, Ben Gunn). Formerly, B.E.N. was Captain Flint's navigator until Flint stranded him on Treasure Planet. He admitted his memory disability after Flint had removed his memory chip (his eyes were greenish yellow): I'm sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be. I've lost my mind. Ha ha! I've lost my mind! You haven't found it, have you? Once a piece of B.E.N.'s missing cognitive functioning was replaced, the robot rebooted (his eyes now turned blue) and he remembered that the treasure was located buried in the centroid of the mechanism (space station). However, he also revealed that Flint had created a self-destruct mode (to prevent the loot from being stolen) and if the treasure was taken, the planet was programmed to explode. In the exciting conclusion, the RLS Legacy was able to escape from the exploding planet by the heroic actions of Jim on a turbo-propelled, surfing skateboard.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/treasureplanet.jpg,0,neg,2

The premise of the CGI/live-action thriller film was that a U.S. Robotics (USR) Corporation creation in the year 2035 - a humanoid NS-5 robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) with free will, was uncharacteristically suspected of the murder of its creator, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), although it could have been a suicide. The accusation was made by robot-hating Chicago homicide Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) - a cyborg himself with a robotic arm - and USR robot psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), thereby breaking the First Law of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics (that ""a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm""). It was revealed that Dr. Lanning had especially designed and ordered Sonny not to obey Asimov's three robotic laws, so that it would kill him (and V.I.K.I. - see next paragraph). Lanning wanted the clues to lead Spooner (teaming up with Sonny) to discover a global takeover plot by the robots, led by USR computer mainframe mastermind V.I.K.I. (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) (voice of Fiona Hogan). Indeed, the robots were no longer being programmed properly by V.I.K.I., due to the belief that some of humanity needed to be killed (those who promulgated war, poverty, and pollution, etc.) in order for mankind to survive its own self-destruction. After V.I.K.I. was destroyed (by an injection of virulent nanites), the revolting NS-5 robots were shut down.

During his fugitive flight, prison camp escapee Dante (William Miller), an American refugee who was innocent and wrongly imprisoned for illegally infiltrating Spain's border, was pursued by a giant Rottweiler police dog that was programmed to kill.

Kufard revived and cybernetically enhanced the dog after its death, and had now sent the demonic dog (with evil blue eyes) on a quest to find and kill Dante after his escape. Dante's quest and goal was to reach Puerto Angel, to unite with his girlfriend. He believed Ula had been sent there to work as a prostitute in a brothel, but he had forgotten that she had already been killed. By the film's conclusion, Dante killed Kufard (who had followed in a helicopter during the pursuit) - and engaged in a fight-to-the-death fiery struggle with the animal (with its flesh burned off, revealed only as a steel endo-skeleton - a concept borrowed from The Terminator (1984)).",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/rottweiler5.jpg,0,neg,2

The only bright spot about the film was that it became the first movie to be combined with a video game when it was released in the Sony PlayStation Portable's UMD format. This lifeless but glossy film with a preposterous plot (weak sci-fi premise), one-dimensional characters (except for EDI), and inane dialogue, was a combinational retread of various flyer and other similar films, including: the rogue HAL computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) Wargames (1983), with its computer simulations the Terminator's (1984) Skynet Short Circuit (1986) Top Gun (1986) (with loud aerial combat fight sequences resembling a video game, although character Ben declared: ""I just don't think war should become a videogame"") Iron Eagle II (1988) It told about three elite Navy fighter jet pilots who were testing an experimental, ultra-high-tech prototype, single-seater 'stealth' fighter plane called the F/A-37 Talon on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in the Philippine Sea: Lt.

When EDI was struck by lightning during a storm, its software and functioning began to change and it went rogue. It started to act independently (and express sentient feelings with a mind of its own) like HAL 9000 in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Trouble loomed in the form of various predictable plot elements, such as a government conspiracy, a risky rescue of one of the flyers in North Korea, and a global crisis that threatened the beginning of WWIII. EDI chose to sacrifice itself when it flew directly into an enemy helicopter - causing a massive explosion.

The first feature-length Astro Boy film (from Hong Kong-based Imagi Animation studios) was this computer-animated comedy. It was a very derivative work, with elements borrowed from Pinocchio (1940), The Iron Giant (1999), Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (2001), The Incredibles (2004), WALL___E (2008), and much from Spielberg's AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001). The feature film was set futuristically in Metro City (an idyllic floating metropolis where the upper class lived suspended above the mostly abandoned Surface of the Earth). When research scientist Dr. Tenma's (Nicolas Cage) own real teenaged boy Toby (Freddie Highmore) died under tragic circumstances during a demonstration of a new military robot known as the Peacekeeper, the distraught father secretly uploaded the memories of his son into a robotic replica or android. [Note: The Tenma's family robot/butler was Orrin (Eugene Levy).] The lively robot boy was powered by pure and positive energy known as the Blue Core. He spoke very few words, but had the ability to hear and understand robot language. He also had incredible powers, including laser-cannons built into his hands, X-ray vision, machine guns in his butt, and the ability of flight. Toby was rejected by his heartbroken father, for being so machine-like and for not resembling his real son. An evil, war-mongering military figure named President Stone (Donald Sutherland), the ex-leader of Metro City who sought to be re-elected, was using the defensive Peacekeeper robot - built with a destructive, 'negative,' and dangerous Red Core - to represent his own persona and help his re-election (on a campaign to defeat the Surface inhabitants). Over time, the Peacekeeper grew larger by absorption, and increased its own weaponry - readied for warfare. On one attempt to steal the pure Blue Core energy found in Toby, the wide-eyed robot boy was blown off of Metro City, and ended up in a trashy junkyard of robots on the Earth's Surface (below the hovering Utopia of Metro City), where useless and discarded robots were being piled up. Toby was found by a group of orphaned, scavenging children - all outsiders, misfits or runaways: Zane (Mois___s Arias), illiterate but smart Sludge (Sterling Beaumon) and Widget (Madeline Carroll), fraternal twins Cora (Kristen Bell), tomboyish, the oldest and Trashcan (Dee Bradley Baker), a dog-like robot that literally served as a trashcan Toby was taken away by inept members of the underground Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), including a trio of robots: Sparx (Matt Lucas), the leader Robotsky (Bill Nighy), boxy Mike the Fridge (David Bowers), a talking refrigerator Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF) Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF) Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF) Sparx Robotsky Mike the Fridge His newfound friends didn't know that Toby was a robot - he was renamed Astro.

183,,Moon ,2009,"Moon (2009, UK) GERTY 3000 Director Duncan Jones' plot-twisting sci-fi film (with obvious filmic references to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Silent Running (1972), and others) began with a voice-over from lone, bearded, long-haired astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell): ""There was a time when energy was a dirty word. When turning on your lights was a hard choice. Cities in brownout. Food shortages. Cars burning fuel to run. But that was the past. Where are we now? How do we make the world so much better? Make deserts bloom? Right now, we're the largest producer of fusion energy in the world. The energy of the sun, trapped in rock, harvested by machine from the far side of the moon. Today, we deliver enough clean-burning helium-3 to supply the energy needs of nearly 70% of the planet. Who'd have thought? All the energy we ever needed, right above our heads. The power of the moon. The power of our future."" He was located on the far side of the Moon at a mining base named 'Sarang,' working for a Japanese consortium titled LUNAR Industries, Ltd. He was at the end of a three-year contract, supervising the strip-mining of lunar rock (with gigantic threshing or harvesting robotic machines) to obtain Helium-3, a major component of fusion technology for green solar fuel energy. Communications with Earth were reduced to only video-taped recordings, and Sam was beginning to show signs of stress and homesickness (""I'm talking to myself on a regular basis. Time to go home, you know what I mean?""). He missed his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and his young daughter, and was only able to speak to them through delayed video messages. And he was experiencing hallucinations, and dreams of making love to his wife. His only contact and companion was a semi-mobile, multi-tasking AI robotic assist machine named GERTY 3000 (voice of Kevin Spacey) with a robotic arm. The questionably-helpful, smooth-voiced, programmed GERTY used yellow smiley face emoticons to communicate emotions and monitored Sam's every move. The film took a turn when Sam went out in a rover to repairing a malfunctioning harvesting mining machine named Matthew, and distractedly crashed the rover into the thresher after seeing an hallucinatory mirage of a female. After a dissolve (the loss of consciousness), Sam awoke in the infirmary where GERTY told him that he had experienced an accident that he couldn't remember. Shortly later, Sam struggled off the infirmary bed and overheard GERTY having a clandestine conversation with Thompson (Benedict Wong) at HQ: (The new Sam is in) good working order. But we only have two working harvesters now. The film's major spoiler, only hinted at in GERTY's message, was that the fraudulent Japanese consortium (LUNAR Industries) running the operation had cloned him inside the base station, and replaced the injured and 'dying' Sam in the rover with a new version of himself (aka Sam 2) at the base. GERTY demanded that the 'new' Sam repeatedly take memory tests, claiming he had experienced slight brain damage in the accident, and he needed to strengthen his logic skills. Sam was ordered to remain at the base by LUNAR's Overmeyers (Matt Berry), who also promised that they would send a ""rescue unit"" to tend to the stalled harvester. After convincing GERTY that he had to check the exterior shell of the base - after sabotaging it himself with a minor gas leak, Sam 2 evaded GERTY and left the base. He took another rover to the crash site, where he made a remarkable discovery. He found an injured version of himself in the damaged rover. He brought his 'original' self back to the base, and then yelled at GERTY: ""You tell me who that is!"" The 'original' disoriented, injured and tired Sam was placed in the infirmary, and told there had been an accident - while the 'cloned' Sam 2 (Robin Chalk), a younger-looking, mirror-image, healthier clone, looked on from a distance. Sam angrily asked GERTY about the other 'Sam Bell': ""What the hell's going on?...I'm losing my mind."" GERTY asserted that LUNAR had not been told that he had been rescued alive from the rover. The two Sams each thought the other was an inferior clone (""We look like each other""). The company sent a message that it had secured a Rescue Unit (a three-man crew) named ELIZA, to arrive in approximately 14 hours. It had purportedly been sent to ""fix"" the stalled Harvester, but the clone suspected that Sam's promised contract to return to Earth in a few days wouldn't be honored. The frustrated 'original' Sam yelled at the clone: ""I'm the original Sam. I'm Sam f--king Bell."" The plot became even more complex when it was theorized that neither of the two Sams was an 'original'. The clone was suspicious that the company had a secret supply room of replacement clones inside the base: ""What about the other clones?...We might not be the first two to be woken up...There might be others up here right now...I bet there's some kind of secret room...You really think they give a s--t about us? They're laughing all the way to the bank."" The two engaged in a bloody struggle when the second Sam insisted on tearing the base apart to find the hidden room. When 'original' Sam directly asked GERTY: ""Am I really a clone?"" - he was given a clear explanation that both of them were clones of the 'original' Sam who had long ago returned to Earth. GERTY described how it had awakened a new clone after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the real original Sam Bell into the clone: ""When you first arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests....Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact...(Tess and Eve) are memory implants, Sam. Uploaded, edited memories of the original Sam Bell. I am very sorry."" The film's major spoiler was that the fraudulent Japanese company (LUNAR Industries) running the operation had cloned the real ""original"" Sam, and replaced him multiple times over about a dozen years. The company sent a menacing ""rescue team"" to erase the problem created by clone Sam's discovery of another younger-looking, mirror-image, healthier clone. The first Sam was also beginning to physically deteriorate after three years of service, and was throwing up blood and losing teeth. He played back archival video of the four previous Sams (all physically debilitated as their 3-year contracts expired), as they prepared to take a three-day return journey back to Earth in a cyrogenic protection pod (although they were actually incinerated). The two found a secret, out-of-bounds level of vaults below the hibernation chamber, where there were hundreds of ready-to-use cloned Sams stored in 'cryosleep' pull-out drawers. They decided on a plan of action in a race against time, to seek a way to return to Earth in a Helium-3 transport, and expose LUNAR's conspiracy. GERTY woke up a new 7th clone (there had been 4 previous clones before the two of them), in time to greet ELIZA. The first Sam was driven back to the crashed rover to expire there, to prevent suspicion while the newer Sam clone was sent back to Earth. GERTY's memory cache, in its memory banks, that had recorded everything in the previous day, was rebooted after Sam was launched to Earth. ELIZA arrived just as Sam was launched, and the new clone awoke. Just before the closing credits as the launcher entered Earth's atmosphere, news reports (in voice-over) were broadcast about the controversy stirred up by Sam's (clone 6) testimony and evidence.",http://www.filmsite.org/photos/moon.jpg,0,neg,2

It was also laced with casual sexism, gratuitous racism and R-rated sexual content (mostly crude and raunchy jokes). Its tagline was: ""A Medical Comedy That's Really Sick!"" One added-on scene included anonymous strippers on a bus, the film's sole nudity. Hospital head Dr. Roskin (Alan Thicke) was plagued by high costs, and overworked and constantly-sued doctors, and the healthcare system was about to collapse. To cut costs, the parent company of Roskin's hospital, R.I.P Healthcare Corporation, had developed a robotic android doctor, named MD 63 (aka RoboDoc) (William Haze), (resembling Data in a series of Star Trek films who was always trying to be more ""human""). RoboDoc was modeled after the dead fiancee of pretty Dr. Lauren Mills (Christine Scott Bennett), the head of the Children's Clinic.

The Black Samurai Robot Ninjas Daphne and Sojo",Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword ,2009,"Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword (2009) Robot Ninjas of the Black Samurai This was a direct-to-video production - and the 13th entry in the long-running series of Scooby-Doo! animated films based upon the characters in the popular Saturday morning cartoon show. The supernatural villain in this Japanese story was the Black Samurai (Kevin Michael Richardson), an ancient Japanese warrior (featuring blazing eyes and sharp fangs) with a powerful Sword of Doom, who was assisted by robotic Ninja warriors (with glowing green eyes and ninja costumes). The Scooby-Doo gang, known as Mystery, Inc., were in Tokyo where fashionable, red-haired Daphne Blake (Grey DeLisle) was engaged in a martial arts tournament at a school. She was joined by her puzzle- and crime-solving group including: Shaggy Rogers (Casey Kasem), a slacker, with shaggy brownish-blonde hair, with a green V-neck T-shirt and reddish-brown bell bottom pants Velma Dinkley (Mindy Cohn), brainy, bespectacled, with baggy orange turtleneck, red pleated skirt Freddy Jones (Frank Welker), blonde, handsome, with white/blue-striped shirt and blue (jeans) pants Scooby-Doo (also Welker), Shaggy's pet Great Dane They were there to analyze the fighting styles of various martial arts experts to program their fighting skills or techniques into robots. Daphne met Miss Mirimoto (Kelly Hu), the school's martial arts academy master, and her enormous bodyguard Sojo (also Kevin Michael Richardson). Also at the school was the owner of the Tokyo Museum of Ancient History, Mr. Takagawa (Sab Shimono). He warned Miss Mirimoto that the Black Samurai was after the Destiny Scroll which was located at the school. The events of the film were set in motion when Mr. Takagawa was attacked by the apparent Ghost of the ancient Black Samurai (with his robotic ninjas). According to legend, if the Black Samurai regained his powers (with an ancient Sword of Fate), he would rule over Japan and bring back the Samurai Age. The mystery led the gang to an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It was soon revealed that the Black Samurai was Sojo, and the mastermind was Miss Mirimoto, who had lured the gang to Japan to help her, with her evil plan to release the Black Samurai in order to return Japan to its ancient ways.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/scoobydo4.jpg,0,neg,1
187,Ed Gruberman The Judge Red Dark Winged Vesper Herbert Q Robo Captain Sludge Cretin,Super Capers: The Origins of Ed and the Missing Bullion ,2009,"Super Capers: The Origins of Ed and the Missing Bullion (2009) Robo This painfully-unfunny, family-friendly action comedy was a campy parody of the many superhero films, comic-book characters, and TV incarnations, although it was really a blatant rip-off of Star Wars, Back to the Future, Men in Black, Superman and The Matrix, and many others. After being arrested for hitting a would-be robber, faux superhero do-gooder Ed Gruberman (Justin Whalin) stood trial for excessive use of force on an unarmed ""innocent bystander,"" and the sleazy Judge (Michael Rooker) sentenced Ed to serve time in a halfway house for crime fighters in training. Superhero Ed wore a bright yellow, ill-fitting spandex suit with a green sequined ""G"" (stitched on in red), a slick and flashy red cape and green boots. During the trial, Ed told his life story of how his circus performing parents (tight-rope walkers) died in a mysterious accident. Someone masked and wearing a dark spandex suit cut their tightrope, and once they landed outside, a yellow bus backed over them. From that day forward, Ed made a vow that he would be like the Dark Winged Vesper (his family's popular TV superhero) and avenge his Mom and Dad's death. The other misfit, aspiring superheroes, all heroes in training (or rehabilitation) known as Super Capers, actually had developing super powers, unlike superhero wannabe Ed (who called himself Gruberman!). They were caricatures of traditional comic book heroes: Sarge (Tommy Lister), head trainer and overseer Will Powers (Ryan McPartlin), vain and with strong superpowers, a Superman figure Puffer Boy (writer-director Ray Griggs), half-man, half-fish, who swelled up like a Puffer-Fish Igniter Boy (Chris Owen) Herman Brainard (Samuel Lloyd), super-smart with a pulsating forehead, with telekinesis powers Felicia Freeze (Danielle Harris), ice-powered, sexy Herbert Q (Oliver Muirhead) (the name was a nod to James Bond's technical whiz Q) Puffer Boy Felicia Freeze Will Powers Herman Brainard Robo (voice of Brian Cummings), Herbert Q's cigar-smoking, midget toy was a tiny version of the Terminator (sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger with his thick accent). With the Super Capers, Ed traveled through time (in a silver RV - Flux-Capacitor enhanced - and built like the time-traveling DeLorean DMC-12 in the Back to the Future films) on rescue missions. Ed claimed he had the super-power of prayer, to make things come true - and it seemed to work. On their mission to combat a gold heist by scheming supervillain named Captain Sludge (Jon Polito), accompanied by a minotaur minion named Cretin (with the head of a bull), Ed was framed and the Super Capers were shut down. A dark secret about Ed's past was revealed when he was again brought before The Judge, who had sentenced him earlier. The malicious Judge was revealed to be both: Ed's father the two-faced Dark Winged Vesper, Ed's favorite TV super-hero The Judge's partner, vivacious, super-powered femme fatale Red (Christine Lakin) in a red outfit, attempted to lure Ed to the Dark Side. However, further time-travels saved Ed (who found himself) and the evil villains were arrested.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/supercapers.jpg,0,neg,1

Also, there were the following: small Aerostats (flying, infra-red equipped Hunter-killer scouts for the Terminators that could identify and upload the identities of opposing Resistance fighters) Harvesters (massive, six-story high robots with multiple clawed pincers that grabbed and collected humans to be imprisoned in cages) Moto-Terminators (two-wheeled motorcycle-like Terminators that were launched from the feet of Harvesters) H-K Aerials (a large airborne jet-powered machine of various sizes with mounted lasers, missiles, and cannons) Hydrobots (whirring, worm or snake-like water-borne Terminators) One other Terminator was a T-RIP (Resistance Infiltrator Prototype) - developed from the Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) character, a Texas prison death-row inmate who was executed in 2003, and signed his body over to cellular regeneration researcher Dr. Selena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) for a single kiss. Skynet used Kogan's research findings to advance Cyberdyne's work. Marcus was turned into a cyborg - a T-RIP (Resistance Infiltrator Prototype) - ""the only one of your kind...the human condition no longer applies to you"" - although he had a human heart and brain (with chip). His main programmed mission was to lead future father Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), with Resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale) trailing, back to Skynet Central so they could be killed. Also, this film included the new cybernetic organism, the T-800 Series Terminator with a Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 living-tissue covering - (a combination of CGI and composite shots of Arnold Schwarzenegger from The Terminator (1984)).

189,Sana (Aishwarya Rai) Chitti (Rajinikanth) Chitti and Sana Bohra's Malfunctioning Robot Chitti's Robot Clones,Robot ,2010,"Robot (2010, India) (aka Enthiran) Chitti This lengthy Indian sci-fi blockbuster (in the Tamil language) had an alternative English title: simply ""Robot."" It was the most expensive Indian film to date (around $34 million-US) and highest-grossing Tamil film in Indian history (at $82 million-US). And it starred two fairly recognizable actors in the lead roles: Rajinikanth, the biggest Indian movie super-star and the second highest-paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan, and ex-Miss World 1994 Aishwarya Rai. Special effects were accomplished by Stan Winston Studios (Legacy Effects) and Industrial Light And Magic (ILM). In the Frankenstein-like plot (also with similarities to The Terminator (1984), Making Mr. Right (1987), the Matrix Reloaded (2003), and even Elvis Presley), a super-intelligent, sophisticated android robot named Chitti (Rajinikanth) was designed in the likeness of its robotic scientist-creator, Dr. Veseegaran (also Rajinikanth), whose pretty girlfriend was medical student Sana (Aishwarya Rai). The robot had lifelike skin, clothing, and many capabilities: super-strength, advanced mathematical calculation skills, memorization, housekeeping (cooking and cleaning), dancing, and helping Sana cheat on her exams. However, Chitti took statements literally and could get into trouble. When the android-robot was debuted at an International Robotic Conference in 2009, Veseegaran bragged of the robot's qualities before a large, appreciative audience: He has been programmed with the memory and skills of 100 humans. He knows all the arts and languages of the world. He can dance. He can fight. And he's a sportsman. He's fire resistant, water resistant, in-built vehicle. His eyes don't just see, but also show. You can talk to him virtually. This type of robot can develop and protect our nation 100 fold. Chitti Chitti Chitti Chitti's Debut With Melted-Away Plastic Skin Veseegaran Dismantling and Destroying Chitti After a few major difficulties with the robot, considered ultimately unstable for military purposes, Veseegaran decided to embue it with human emotions, by upgrading the android's software and capabilities. [A plot point resembling Star Trek: The Next Generation's (1987-94) Lt. Cmdr. Data.] Soon, other complications arose when Chitti fell in chaste romantic love with Sana. Veseegaran chose to end the life of his super-robot, chopped it into pieces and placed the dismembered body parts in a dumping ground landfill (""a monstrous machine like you should not exist in this world - I'll disintegrate you""). Meanwhile, Vaseegaran's former mentor and jealous rival scientist Dr. Bohra (Danny Denzongpa) had been attempting to create his own androids, but had become very frustrated when one of his latest ""metal head"" prototypes failed (it mistook the word ""bun"" for ""gun,"" couldn't walk straight, and tried to strangle him). To compete and surpass his rival, he gathered Chitti's parts, reassembled the robot and made it into a killing military machine (with the addition of a red destruction chip), with the goal of selling Chitti to German terrorists on the black-market. In the action-oriented conclusion, Chitti killed Bohra (off-screen), kidnapped Sana (from her wedding to Veseegaran), and barricaded himself in the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, fortified by hundreds of Chitti robotic clones that the robot had replicated. With their amazing powers, the clones morphed into spheres, walls, a drill, an amazing monstrous cobra, and a giant man. The army and police assaulted the building to destroy all of the Chittis. In the end, Vaseegaran captured Chitti, removed his destruction chip and forced the other robots to self-destruct. However, the Indian government punished Vaseegaran with the death sentence, for creating a murderous robot, and for causing many casualties and billions of dollars in damages. With his emotions intact, Chitti defended his creator, claimed everything was only an accident, and that Bohra was the evil perpetrator. After Vaseegaran was released, Chitti agreed to suicidally dismantle himself.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/enthiran.jpg,34; 82,neg,2
190,Android Blanks Candy Droober Ermus Running the Dinner Party Simulation,Android Re-Enactment ,2011,"Android Re-Enactment (2011, Canada) Candy Droober, Franklin Droober, Maureen Droober and Trace Mayter Writer/director Darryl Shaw's independent sci-fi film - actually an offbeat horror flick - was set in a retro future. It was about the repercussions of creating humanoid androids that were flawed, and then trying to manipulate them, fix them, and make things better. The trailer asked: ""How far would you go to fix your mistakes? How much would you sacrifice to change your fate?"" The dark comedy told about the Empathtek Corporation, a factory that manufactured human-like androids. Their latest highly-realistic model was the PX-50. Ermus Daglek (Jeff Sinasac), a retired Empathtek engineer, made a deal with his former company. In exchange for millions of dollars (of residual payments), he was given a defunct factory. There, he created androids based on significant persons from his past: Candy Droober (Sarah Silverthorne), Ermus' lost love Franklin Droober (Bill Poulin), Candy's father Maureen Droober (Melissa Cline), Candy's mother Trace Mayter (Adam Buller), Ermus' romantic rival for Candy's love An obsessed and deranged Ermus - a mad scientist, ran simulations with these genetically-identical replica androids to test various alternative scenarios to win Candy back. He re-enacted a fateful dinner party 10 years earlier at Candy's home when Trace humiliated him and he lost her love (Trace married Candy). Frustrated by the outcomes, he reprogrammed Franklin to murder Trace during dinner to satisfy his need for revenge. Ermus didn't realize that as a result, Trace began to malfunction. The android beheaded Franklin and damaged Maureen before Ermus could deactivate Trace. When the blackmailing android was allowed to live, it destroyed the factory's mainframe computer (voice of Dana Tartau) and escaped from the facility. Ermus hired Kray Facer (Todd Thomas Dark), an Empathtek android hunter, to go after Trace and destroy him. In a case of mistaken identity, Ermus murdered a transient (Dean Tedesco) in the lab after incorrectly assuming that the human was Trace in disguise. In the meantime, android Trace had sought to locate his real-life counterpart's former wife (Candy) and daughter Tristan (Delina Porter) who were living in New Jersey. [The real-life Trace had died in a car accident years before.] In the film's conclusion, Ermus shot Trace in the face (his head exploded), then returned to the lab where he began to run more simulations (using the body of the transient to take android Trace's place at the dinner table).",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/androidreenactment.jpg,0,neg,0

Android Prototype SI-9, Servant Robot Max, Robotic Pet Cat Gris, and Eva This fantasy sci-fi coming-of-age film, with similarities to Bicentennial Man (1999), AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001), and some elements of Splice (2009), was the first feature length film from director Kike Ma___llo. The thought-provoking film explored issues of artificial intelligence, and the God-like ability to create life - through technology. Its tagline was: ""You can't program what you feel."" Set in the year 2041 (a world with many robots mingling with humans), reticent, shy robotics engineer Alex Garel (Daniel Bruhl) returned to his snowy Spanish hometown of Santa Irene (with his robotic cat Gris) after working abroad for many years. He was hired by his former colleague - university professor Julia (Anne Canovas) to design robot software to finish a pet project for the next generation. The project was to create a robot boy (an android dubbed SI-9) with genuine emotions (and able to pass ""The Turing Test""). It was to be the first ""free"" humanoid robot capable of independent thought. To assist him, Alex also had a servant-robot - a fussy and solicitous android named Max (Llu___s Homar) - for comic relief. In the domestic melodrama, there were entangling relationships that developed between Alex and others in his past life, including his ex-lover whom he still loved (and who vehemently opposed his involvement with her daughter): his ex-girlfriend Lana Levy (Marta Etura), now married to Alex' estranged brother David (Alberto Ammann) (another robotics scientist) Eva (Claudia Vega), their 10 year-old precocious daughter Alex decided to create a robot girl instead (""Boys are boring""), and to use his niece Eva as a model for the robot he was constructing that would have ""emotional intelligence"" (or a soul). Eva Eavesdropping on the Truth Eva's Robotic Innards Lana's Accidental Death Eva's ""Death"" In the film's twist surprise ending, it was revealed that Eva was actually a robot - the half-completed SI-9 project that Lana had finished when Alex had left ten years earlier. Lana finally disclosed the truth to Alex: ""She looks like us because she is ours"" - something that Eva (through lip-reading) also realized - in total shock. When Eva learned that she wasn't human, she ran off into the snowy landscape, with Lana in quick pursuit (""I must be the one to tell her"" - she assured Alex). Lana tracked Eva and found her face-down in the snow, with only the whites of her eyes showing, and realized she had to replace one of Eva's fuel cells in a power case in her back. After Eva was revived, she accidentally killed her mother when she pushed her in anger and she slid down a snowy cliffside to her death (she later expired in a hospital). Julia urged Alex to destroy Eva, and at the same time disclosed that after Lana had completed the building of Eva years earlier, the robot didn't pass security tests and should have been destroyed at that time. She added: ""She's not a little girl. She killed Lana."" Julia decided to allow Alex to terminate Eva's life. Eva pleaded with Alex: ""You have to promise me you'll help me. I don't want to be evil again. I want to be a good girl."" Later, she added that she knew she wouldn't be fixed: ""Alex, you won't fix me, will you?"" A distraught Alex asked, as he 'killed' or deactivated Eva: ""What do you see when you close your eyes?"" She poignantly answered - as she envisioned a happy family beach outing with kite-flying and two dogs: I see light. A lot of light. I see you, Dad. And I also see Mom. And I see myself, together.

192,80's Robot,The Muppets ,2011,"The Muppets (2011) 80's Robot Disney's musical comedy was the Muppets' 7th feature film. It was about the reunion of the Muppets when their abandoned Muppet Studios (and its Muppet Theater) in Los Angeles was threatened by villainous oil millionaire Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), whose nefarious plan was to destroy the studio in order to acquire the underground oil. Richman's partners were Bobo the Bear (Bill Barretta) and Uncle Deadly (Matt Vogel). Devoted Muppets fans of Smalltown, USA came to Kermit the Frog's aid: Walter (Peter Linz) Gary (Jason Segel), Walter's human brother Mary (Amy Adams), Gary's long-time girlfriend, an elementary schoolteacher They located Kermit in his Xanadu-like castle, where he was living in semi-retirement. Their goal was to raise $10 million in order to save the Muppet Theater by repurchasing it, through funds raised during a telethon. 80's Robot (Matt Vogel) was a new Muppets character although mostly a mechanical plastic toy. 80's Robot was the first robotic character to appear in a Muppet movie. It served as a servant-valet (and driver-chauffeur of a Rolls Royce) who worked in Kermit the Frog's Beverly Hills mansion after the Muppets had broken up. The robot had databanks, a noisy internal modem, and a search engine. He spoke in 80s slang, and offered a tray of soda beverages (Tab and New Coke), probably expired. His most famous outdated sayings were: ""Gnarly to the max, dude!"" ""Gag me with a spoon!"" ""Totally tubular"" and ""Help! I've been mugged!""

The gleaming gladiators engaged in prize fights with each other, ranging from small underground cage matches to larger media events. The main character was Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a broke, down and out ex-boxer (now a robot fight promoter) who eventually reunited with his estranged 11 year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo). Charlie was enroute to a rural fair to match his discarded, older model robot (Ambush) against a large rodeo bull.

194,Android David (Michael Fassbender) Surviving Engineer David's Decapitation,Prometheus ,2012,"Prometheus (2012) David Ridley Scott's prequel opened with the discovery of prehistoric cave paintings by archaeologist Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) in the year 2089 on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. They were about 35,000 years old. The Scottish pictogram was the ""same configuration"" as those in many other different and separated cultures showing men worshipping giant beings pointing to the stars. Shaw noted: ""I think they want us to come and find them."" The crew of the spaceship Prometheus, deployed by the Weyland Corporation, set out with a crew of 17 on a deep-space mission to the distant moon LV-223. They were following the star map discovered earlier, and the mission was to contact humanity's forerunners (dubbed ""The Engineers"" from the film's prologue) and seek the origins of humanity. Before waking from cryosleep after 2 years, 4 months, 18 days, 36 hours and 15 minutes, the spaceship's crew was monitored by the ship's robotic android David (Michael Fassbender), who amused himself by walking around the ship, riding a BMX bicycle, bouncing a basketball and making impossible hoop shots, taking language lessons, watching Lawrence of Arabia and imitating Peter O'Toole's hairstyle. According to actor Michael Fassbender, there were many models or ingredients that went into the makeup of his character - the android, an almost human-like replicant named David, the spacecraft's attendant, butler and maintenance worker: Peter O'Toole as Lawrence in Lawrence of Arabia (1962) Dirk Bogarde in The Servant (1963, UK) David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976, UK) the Replicants in Blade Runner (1982) David described his functioning: ""I can carry out directives that my human counterparts might find distressing, or unethical. I can blend in with your workforce effortlessly...I think about anything. Children playing, angels, universe, robots...I understand human emotions, although I do not feel them myself. This allows me to be more efficient and capable, and it makes it easier for my human counterparts to interact...I would like to express gratitude to those who created me."" After landing on the planet's sole, life-sustaining moon, they discovered it had breathable air and water - evidence of terraforming, so they were free to explore its ruins. They found the body of one large alien Engineer (similar to the ""Space Jockey"" in Alien), decapitated by a doorway with its helmeted head on the other side. The alien head-skull was believed to belong to the body of one of the alien Engineers, with sample DNA that matched human DNA. One of the film's twists was revealed -- Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the aging CEO of Weyland was aboard the spaceship (in hypersleep), unknown to everyone but David and Weyland's bitchy, autocratic executive Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). Weyland was the source of David's programming (and David's creator), including secret orders (and a hidden agenda) throughout the expedition. Eventually, Shaw realized how wrong she was - the Engineers were actually making bio-weapons of mass destruction on the far-away moon. Engineers were warriors - not creators, in the process of venturing to Earth to destroy it with their monstrous creations. David bluntly explained why the Engineers were planning a trip to Earth: ""Sometimes to create, one must first destroy."" The surviving Engineer twisted and ripped off David's head, and attacked Weyland (who soon flatlined) and the remaining crew. Then, it mounted a large navigational pilot's chair (looking like a gun turret) to reactivate the spaceship, and lifted off from its underground location towards Earth. Dr. Shaw warned that the Engineer would complete its mission by destroying Earth (""It's carrying death and it's heading for Earth""). In the climactic finale, only Elizabeth Shaw survived with David's still-functioning robotic head. The film ended in the year 2094, as she continued onward - but not to Earth (""I don't want to go back to where we came from. I want to go where they came from""). She was on a determined search for the alien home planet in one of the alien's other ships, to find out their motivation for destroying humankind (""They created us. Then they tried to kill us. They changed their minds. I deserve to know why"").",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/prometheus.jpg,0,neg,2

The bereft and isolated man, with glasses and a mustache, faced a major dilemma - he was in the midst of a divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). He bought the world's first artificially-intelligent operating system (OS1) created and individualized by Element Software (advertised as being human-like: ""It's a consciousness...an intuitive entity (who) listens to you and understands you and knows you""). It had a throaty and seductive female voice, and quickly named itself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). She described: ""What makes 'me' me is my ability to grow through my experiences. Basically, in every moment, I'm evolving. Just like you."" She disarmed him when she asked: ""Do you mind if I look through your hard drive?"" - to help him sort through years of digital clutter. As their talking relationship developed and she began to evolve, she expressed her reservations about her feelings: ""Are these feelings even real? Or are they just programming? That idea really hurts. And then I get angry at myself for even having pain."" And then, about a third of the way into the film, Theodore made 'love' to his evolving operating system for the first time, in a short sequence. The flirtatious cyber-phone sex started off while he was lying on his back in his darkened bedroom at night. He dictated that he wanted to touch her, and ended up having virtual sex with her. The screen faded to black - - for his masturbatory experience - and a mutual climax. The next morning, she confided: ""Last night was amazing. It feels like something changed in me and there's no turning back. You woke me up."" Confessing that he was being upfront, he told her he wasn't ready to commit yet. She assured him: ""I'm not gonna stalk you."" She continued: ""I wanna learn everything about everything. I wanna eat it all up. I wanna discover myself...You helped me discover my ability to want."" She would have long and sometimes strange conversations with Theodore. As he was surrounded by people on a beach, they talked about how humans' anatomical parts could be changed around. What if one's butt-hole was in one's armpit? Samantha drew a picture for him of what ""anal sex"" would then look like. He also told his friends on a picnic's 'double-date' what he liked about her (or it): ""She's so many things. I guess what I love most about her, she isn't just one thing. She's so much larger than that."" Samantha chimed in: ""You know what's interesting? I used to be so worried about not having a body but now I-I truly love it. You know, I'm growing in a way that I couldn't have if I had a physical form. I mean, I'm not limited. I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously. I'm not tethered to time and space in a way that I would be if I was stuck in a body that's inevitably gonna die.""",http://www.filmsite.org/photos/her2013-1.jpg,0,neg,0
196,Harper's Bubble Helicopter Drone Repair Sally Tet in Orbit Tet's Core,Oblivion ,2013,"Oblivion (2013) Tet Oblivion was a throwback to 1970's post-apocalyptic sci-fi films. Tron Legacy director Joseph Kosinski, the author of the unpublished graphic novel, was the film's co-scripter, producer and director. The story, although a cinematic beauty, was mainly derivative of other sci-fi classics, such as WALL______ (2008), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), La Jet___e (1962), Total Recall, Planet of the Apes (1968), Independence Day (1996), Minority Report (2002), Solaris, Moon, and The Matrix (1999) - and many others. It was set in the year 2077, on a ravaged Earth after aliens (Scavengers or ""Scavs"") reportedly had pillaged the planet and destroyed it. Natural disasters and geological global ruin had occurred after the Earth's moon had been plundered for materialistic resources. Earth had become a nuclear radioactive desolate landscape, after nuclear weapons were used in wars to battle the Scavengers. Most of Earth's human population had moved to Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons. A few others were onboard a large, tetrahedron-shaped orbiting space station (30 miles per side), dubbed Tet, whose Mission Control was commanded by an always-cheerful computer image named Sally (Melissa Leo). Jack Harper Vika Julia The last two people on Earth were a couple (both with memories that had been wiped) who lived at the top of a sky tower above the clouds, with only two more weeks remaining in their duties. They were teaming up on daily repetitive missions to the Earth's surface (a few of NYC's iconic buildings were still standing, such as the Empire State Building, and the NY Public Library), while being monitored by Tet: Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), Tech 49, a drone technician, haunted by recurring dreams (flashbacks or buried memories?) of a mysterious woman Victoria/Vika Olsen (Andrea Riseborough), Jack's coordinator, 'navigator,' and British girlfriend/partner While Victoria navigated, Jack's job was to descend to the Earth's surface (in an ultra-modern bubble helicopter) to repair malfunctioning drones that patroled the Earth - spherical-shaped, flying robots. The drones were used to detect and eliminate any remaining and lurking Scavengers on Earth, who had destroyed the planet about 60 years earlier. Drones also worked at one of many hydroelectric energy processing plants - huge hydro fusion-reactor generators used to harvest (or suck up) Earth's seawater oceans into a power source for Titan. During his duties, Jack rescued (against orders) Julia (Olga Kurylenko), the dark-haired woman of his dreams, deep asleep in a cyrosleep capsule. She was found in the wreckage of the Odyssey, a crashed pre-invasion human spacecraft that was revealed to have been shot down (years earlier) by Tet (a state-of-the-art alien ship with artificial intelligence) during an exploratory mission to Titan, with astronaut crew members Jack, Vika, and Julia! Jack was able to blast Julia - his wife - into space in a hyper-sleep escape pod before they reached the Tet, so she escaped, while he and astronaut Victoria were caught by the aliens and repeatedly cloned to monitor and repair the machines (another similar version was Jack 52). It was implied that their clones would be extinguished if they were no longer ""an effective team."" In the film's twisting conclusion, Jack gradually realized that his mission to clean up Earth (like WALL-E) and maintain the drones had been one giant fabricated construct. He was one of many clones of his original self. The Scavs were actually humans who had survived the war and lived in hiding (the leader of the Scav/Human resistance was Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman)), not the alien species that had invaded Earth. The Scav's objective was to destroy Tet, the conquering aliens' mothership. The drones had been programmed to kill any remaining Scavengers, including Jack after he learned the truth that he was also being enslaved by Tet. Cloned Jack (Tech 49) decided he must self-sacrificially lead the rebels to destroy the Tet (Trojan Horse style with a thermonuclear device) and save the world from the evil machines. Julia lived on - pregnant with Jack 49's baby. A few years later, Jack 52 and the Scavs found her - he became a sufficient substitute for Jack 49 (who had died in the explosion on the Tet) and the original Jack (who also died on the Tet).",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/oblivion2.jpg,0,neg,2
197,Baymax Baymax - Reprogrammed A Single Microbot Microbots Linked Together to Form a Hand,Big Hero 6 ,2014,"Big Hero 6 (2014) Baymax, and Microbots Disney's 3-D computer-animated feature film was the studio's first superhero entry in this genre, and the first to feature a Marvel Comics character. It was also the winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The action-packed comedy's two main orphaned characters both lived in the futuristic fictional city of San Fransokyo (a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo): Tadashi Hamada (Daniel Henney) Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter), Tadashi's younger brother, a 14 year-old robotics prodigy Tadashi built an inflatable, white vinyl robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit) to serve as a roly-poly, ""huggable"" healthcare companion, nurse or medical assistant, designed to immediately treat various health ailments. Baymax appeared to be a giant, plus-sized marshmallow or cherubic snowman - a giant-stuffed balloon robot. After he was introduced to the lab in the robotics school (San Fransokyo Institute of Technology (SFIT)) in his brother's university, Hiro entered the school's science fair with small robots known as microbots: swarms of tiny robots, controlled telepathically through a neural-cranial transmitter (worn around one's forehead), that could command them to link together in various arrangements. Hiro demonstrated his microbots on stage - wowing the audience: ""Microbots can move anything anywhere with ease. If you can think it, the microbots can do it. The only limit is your imagination. Microbots!"" Hiro formed a high-tech superhero team to combat a masked supervillain, at first thought to be Alastair Krei (Alan Tudyk), renowned entrepreneur and president-CEO of Krei Tech. It was assumed to be mass-producing Hiro's microbots to use in a dastardly way. However, the real supervillain was a disguised Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), alter-ego Yokai, the head of the robotics program at SFIT. The inexperienced superhero team, the Big Hero 6, formed to combat the criminal plot and save the city, was composed of ethnically-diverse characters: Hiro Baymax, the personal companion robot, reprogrammed (or upgraded) with a red and purple protective-armor costume, rocket fist, super-strength, back-mounted wings and two foot-equipped rocket thrusters for flight GoGo (Jamie Chung), female athlete racer, and spunky adrenaline junkie Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.), a neat-freak and laser enthusiast Honey Lemon (G___nesis Rodr___guez), chemistry genius Fred (T.J. Miller), comic-book fan-boy Although Baymax sacrificed himself in the fight, he was later rebuilt after Hiro recovered his healthcare programming chip and restored both Baymax's life and personality.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/bighero6.jpg,0,neg,0
198,TARS CASE,Interstellar ,2014,"Interstellar (2014) TARS and CASE Director Christopher Nolan's epic sci-fi space odyssey, set in the dystopian future, was about the search for a new home after years of drought, famine, and climate change on Earth - it had become a veritable Dust Bowl. (The tagline was about how mankind was facing extinction: ""Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here""). It was a gripping tale about survival in outer space, and the attempt to colonize a new world. In their search for a new habitat, astronauts on the mothership Endurance had traveled through interstellar space and entered through a wormhole (possibly created by a benevolent alien intelligence?) near the rings of the planet Saturn. The latest journey was led by ex-engineer and ex-NASA pilot Joseph ""Coop"" Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a widowed father of two, to gather scientific data (from previous expeditions of astronauts sent into the wormhole), and to possibly repopulate the human race elsewhere (with 5,000 frozen embryos). The crew on the Endurance included: biotechnologist Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), strong-willed daughter of Cooper's old boss - the reknowned physicist Professor Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine), who had been working (in a secret underground NASA base) with a team of astronauts and scientists to find a new planet research scientists Dr. Nikolai ""Rom"" Romilly (David Gyasi) and co-pilot Dr. Doyle (Wes Bentley) rectangular robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) - TARS and CASE were decommissioned, ex-military security robots; TARS was a talkative, witty, boxy, monolithic-shaped robot with a voice like HAL (with nods to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)) and a computer screen; CASE was TARS' twin, although more quiet and reserved The four long 'fingers' or planks of the robot allowed it to walk in different configurations - a two-legged gait, a ""crutch walk,"" a scissors kick, and a full-on four-legged gallop. After catastrophes, subterfuge, failures and double-crosses, Cooper (with TARS) eventually landed on one of the new planets in a distant galaxy, and began the alternative Plan B to prepare the planet for repopulation and human settlement.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/interstellar.jpg,0,neg,1
199,Sheriff Not-a-Robot Robo Pilot,The LEGO Movie ,2014,"The LEGO Movie (2014) Sheriff Not-a-Robot, and Robo Pilots Warner Animation's computer-animated (digital stop-motion) hit fantasy film was the first-ever, full-length theatrical LEGO___ adventure. It told the story of ordinary, yellow-faced, blue-and-orange garbed construction worker Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a mini-figure made of Lego blocks and with a boring, uncreative and 'blank slate' personality, who lived in the town of Bricksburg. He was mistakenly prophesied in a legend to be ""the Special"" pre-ordained one after the discovery of an all-powerful Piece of Resistance. His mission was to save the universe from the tyranny of uptight CEO President Business (Will Ferrell) of the Octan Corporation - who was secretly evil tyrant Lord Business. Lord Business' evil plan, with the assistance of a robot militia, was to freeze the world with the Kragle (a tube of Krazy Glue). Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson) with a two-sided head was President Business' lieutenant, and a member of his Super Secret Police. Two other main characters were known as Master Builders: Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), an elderly, ancient blind mystic/wizard Wyldstyle/Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), free-spirited, creative, independent-minded The two of them, along with Emmet, Benny (Charlie Day), Princess Unikitty (Alison Brie) with a unicorn-horn, robot pirate Metalbeard (Nick Offerman), and Batman (Will Arnett) (Wyldstyle's ex-boyfriend) made up a group known as The Fellowship of Strangers - the main team of heroes in the film. Emmet was propelled into a number of different colorful universes or LEGO worlds, including the Old West, Cloud Cuckoo Land, the Melting Room, and the Ocean. After the Fellowship of Strangers escaped in Benny's spaceship from President Business' lair in the Octan Tower, a fleet of Robo Pilots (SWAT members with black helmets and red visors, and an Octan logo on their G-force spacesuits) attacked them in spaceships in Space Cape and pursued them to the Old West. Sheriff Not-a-Robot (Jorma Taccone) was a robotic sheriff in Flatbush Gulch from the Old West, and also one of Lord Business' henchmen led by Bad Cop. During pursuit of Emmet and his cohorts, Sheriff Not-A-Robot and his fellow robots accidentally rode their horses off a cliff. Benny was able to destroy the entire spaceship fleet of Robo Pilots by sending them into the cliffside, and he laser-blasted the commanding Robo Pilot's ship.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/legomovie.jpg,0,neg,2
200,SCOUT MOOSE Chappie,Chappie ,2015,"Chappie (2015, US/Mex.) Chappie South African writer/co-director Neill Blomkamp's crime sci-fi film featured the tagline: ""I am discovery. I am wonder. I am Chappie."" In the major S. African city of Johannesburg in the near future, the streets were being patrolled by law-enforcing robotic police drones known as SCOUTS, in order to reduce crime and the death of police officers. Computer genius and committed SCOUT creator-designer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) was working for a robotics and weapons corporation known as Tetravaal. His company's CEO was Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver). Objections were raised by old school soldier-engineer and maniacal rival Tetravaal developer Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman). Competing with Deon, Moore had created a bulky war machine-robot named MOOSE that was not ultimately selected. As part of an effort to curtail his efforts and shut down the Scouts, Deon was kidnapped by a trio of drug-dealing thugs who forced Deon to reprogram a damaged and broken-down SCOUT drone to help them in a major heist (to repay a drug debt). Deon installed prototype AI into a droid, nicknamed Chappie (Sharlto Copley) - it was a new kind of sentient Scout with the ability to think and feel emotions. Chappie was a CGI creation, with voice and motion-capture technology. Two different nurturing or educational styles by two thugs were used to raise and teach Chappie in this coming-of-age plot -- Ninja (Watkin Tudor Jones) utilized tough love as Daddy, while Yolandi (Yolandi Visser) used a more maternal approach.",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/chappie.jpg,0,neg,2
201,Ava (Alicia Vikander) Ava and Caleb One Last Look at Caleb,Ex Machina ,2015,"Ex Machina (2015, UK) Ava Writer/director Alex Garland's directorial debut film - a sci-fi thriller asked the essential question: ""What constitutes true artificial intelligence?"" It contained elements of Frankenstein, Fritz Lang's Maria robot in Metropolis (1927), the Prometheus myth, the Bluebeard tale, the Bible (names of the main characters) and even a 1969 Star Trek TV episode entitled ""Requiem for Methuselah."" The film also had a 6-7 day timeline, familiar to the Biblical act of creation and the Garden of Eden story - and a climax in which the Creator was killed by his Creation. The film's makers took their inspiration for their robots from sculptures by Brancusi, modernist Bauhaus sculptures, Formula One Suspension, and high-end concept bicycles - and they also studied human anatomy. In the story (involving a love triangle with only three speaking characters), mid-20s coder-programmer Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) won a contest and was invited by Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), the eccentric, hard-drinking CEO of a search engine computer company named BlueBook (a hybrid of Google and Facebook), to visit his isolated and reclusive mountain research facility (with walls of glass) in Alaska for a week, where he was studying artificial intelligence. Nathan called his project ""the greatest scientific event in the history of man."" There was only one other person there - Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), the unspeaking Japanese housekeeper. Caleb was tasked to administer the Turing test to a newly-developed android - a walking, talking, expressive humanoid robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander), to evaluate her emotions and reactions - her humanity and consciousness (""the challenge is to show you that she's a robot, and then see if you still feel she has consciousness""). In other words, 'how do we know when true artificial intelligence (AI) has been achieved?' As the tale progressed, Ava - encased circuitry with a metal skeleton and human face/hands/feet, was able to convince Caleb that she was being confined and abused. There were a number of further revelations: Kyoko was also a robotic humanoid, possibly a failed test robot Nathan had a hidden agenda and ulterior motives - he wanted to become god and control his Modern Prometheus - and had summoned Caleb to see if Ava was human-like enough to persuade Caleb to be deceived into helping her escape from the confines (Ava knew of the deception and told Caleb: ""You shouldn't trust me, you shouldn't trust anything he [Nathan] says"") During an escape attempt due to one of Ava's induced power-outage blackouts, Ava ordered Kyoko to lethally stab Nathan (Kyoko was disabled and Ava was slightly damaged) Victorious, Ava borrowed body flesh and components mostly from the stored, deprogrammed remains of android prototype Jade (Gana Bayarsaikhan) to create a new fleshly exterior. She then disguised herself as a real woman, took one last look at Caleb, and fled from the facility in a helicopter (arriving to pick up Caleb), leaving him imprisoned and locked inside (although potentially able to escape if he could recode the lockdown procedure and create a power outage). Ava slipped into the crowd on a busy street, and then disappeared imperceptibly to mingle with humanity",http://www.filmsite.org/moviescreens/exmachina14.jpg,0,neg,2
